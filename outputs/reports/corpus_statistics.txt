NCT06020573 Evaluation of Safety and Performance of Intraoperative Detection of Light Signals During Electrosurgical Breast Cancer Resection Breast Cancer, Resection Margin                                                Clip-on electrode with fiber optics INTERVENTIONAL    NaN This monocentric early feasibility first in human study is intended to evaluate safety and performance of intraoperative detection of light signals during electrosurgical breast cancer resection.\n\nIn consequence the data should also be taken to adapt technical features according to the findings. The study results will be utilized to design and to calculate the sample size for future pivotal studies after finalizing this study and to adapt the technical features of the system and/ or device. In the future pivotal study, the effectiveness of method and the reduction in R1 resection rate will be assessed with the final goal to provide continuous or real-time information about the tissue type that is currently cut.\n\nThe primary endpoint for this first in human feasibility study is the percentage of patients with no serious adverse event related to the investigational device.\n\nAfter signing the informed consent the doctor and research team will determine if the participant meets all requirements for this study. During the second visit (V2) they will receive the treatment procedure with the investigational medical device (IMD). The follow up visit (V3) will be performed up to 7 days after the treatment procedure at the day of discharge from the hospital.
