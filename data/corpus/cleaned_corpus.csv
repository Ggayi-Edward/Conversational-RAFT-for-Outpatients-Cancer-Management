Cervical tumors are found in both HIV-infected and HIV-negative women. However, HIV-infected women are at a greater risk, and often their tumors become cancerous more quickly than those in HIV-negative women. Isotretinoin may be able to prevent this from happening. However, since these tumors tend to disappear over time, many doctors are hesitant to give their patients isotretinoin since this drug causes birth defects. This study looks at whether it is better to treat cervical tumors in HIV-infected women or to wait and see if they will disappear by themselves.","Inclusion Criteria

To prevent this, guidelines recommend participation in healthy bone behaviours including weight-bearing exercise and adequate calcium/vitamin D intake. However, prior studies have shown that patients are not regularly screened or counselled regarding healthy bone behaviours while receiving ADT. Maintaining bone health in prostate cancer patients is important because men on ADT are at increased risk of fractures. In this study, the investigators will examine whether an intervention designed to improve healthy bone behaviours among prostate cancer patients on ADT can be implemented. The intervention consists of a written ""healthy bones prescription"", brief verbal counseling, and printed educational materials for participants. Investigators hope to obtain an initial estimate of whether the intervention works. They also hope to show that this simple intervention can be implemented in a real, working cancer clinic.

NCT01978873,Efficacy Study Evaluating Chemotherapy in Prostate Cancer,Prostate Cancer,"Cabazitaxel + Androgen deprivation therapy, Androgen deprivation therapy",INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,"This clinical trial is designed on the basis of an unmet clinical need, as well as other factors including: 1) the ability to identify subjects at high risk of dying early from their disease, 2) the fact that hormonal therapy has already been shown to improve survival when applied early in the natural history, 3) the availability of chemotherapy such as cabazitaxel that can improve survival in subjects with advanced disease and 4) that chemotherapy (docetaxel) given concomitant with hormone treatment has proven to prolong time to progression.

It is the investigators hypothesis that a more appropriate group of patients who may benefit from the curative potential of systemic chemo-hormonal modality is that with minimal, but detectable disease who have a high probability of developing metastatic disease, clinical symptoms and eventually death from prostate cancer in a defined time frame. The investigators hypothesize further that the approach is likely to be more effective at a time of minimal tumour burden, resulting in minimization of the overall burden of therapy and better quality of life while on treatment.

This trial will determine whether any benefit is gained by adding chemotherapy before hormonal therapy to hormonal therapy alone in the population of subjects with metastatic or high risk disease.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT00007631,Determine the Efficacy of Topical Tretinoin Cream for the Prevention of Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer,"Carcinoma, Basal Cell, Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, Skin Neoplasms","Tretinoin 0.1% cream or placebo, Placebo",INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,"One-third of all malignancies in the United States (approximately one million cases diagnosed annually) are nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). NMSC causes considerable morbidity, economic burden, facial deformity and at least 1,000 deaths annually. Prevention of these malignancies with a topical agent free of serious side effects would confer substantial public health benefit. Three hundred fifty thousand veterans were expected to develop NMSC in 1994. NMSC is one of the most common conditions requiring dermatologic care in the VA system. Topical tretinoin has been used extensively to treat photoaged skin. Retinoids administered orally in high doses appear to be effective in chemoprevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer but have unacceptable toxicity. In this study, 1131 patients with a recent history of squamous cell and/or basal cell carcinoma were enrolled at six participating centers over a four-year period and were randomly assigned to either 0.1% tretinoin cream or placebo. They were followed for a minimum of two years to determine if topical tretinoin is effective in reducing the risk of new occurrences.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT03537573,Provider-Targeted Behavioral Interventions to Prevent Unsafe Opioid Prescribing for Acute Pain in Primary Care,"Acute Pain, Headache, Musculoskeletal Pain","Usual Care/Guideline, Opioid Justification, Provider Comparison",INTERVENTIONAL,,"The investigators will assess whether behavioral science-based interventions can ""nudge"" providers towards more evidence-based care for patients with acute non-cancer pain.

Aim 1) Among opioid naïve primary care patients with acute non-cancer pain, compare the effect of the provider-targeted behavioral interventions (opioid justification and provider comparison), individually and in combination, on initial opioid prescription, initial use of non-opioid management, and patient-reported pain and function.

Aim 2) Compare the effect of the 2 provider-targeted behavioral interventions, individually and in combination, on unsafe opioid prescribing and transition to chronic opioid therapy.

Aim 3) Assess provider satisfaction and experience with the provider-targeted behavioral interventions.

Hypotheses:

Aim 1, H1a: Compared with the guideline (usual care) alone, the addition of the opioid justification and provider comparison behavioral interventions will be associated with a decreased proportion of opioid prescription and increased proportion of non-opioid management at the initial outpatient visit for acute non-cancer pain.

Aim 1, H1b: Compared with usual care (guideline) alone, the addition of the opioid justification and provider comparison behavioral interventions will be associated with no difference in patient-reported pain, function, and satisfaction at 1, 6, and 12 months.

Aim 2, H2: Compared with the usual care (guideline), the addition of opioid justification and provider comparison behavioral interventions will be associated with a decreased proportion of patients receiving unsafe opioid therapy and a decreased proportion of patients transitioning to chronic opioid therapy.

Study Design: Pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial in 48 primary care clinics.

Study Population: The patient population will be 19,855 opioid naïve adults who present to clinic with acute uncomplicated musculoskeletal pain or headache.

Primary and Secondary Outcomes: The primary outcome measures will be receipt of an initial opioid prescription and unsafe opioid prescribing. Secondary outcomes will be non-opioid pain management, and, in 514 patients, patient-reported pain and function.

Analytic Plan: The investigators will test for differences in the primary and secondary outcomes among the 4 intervention groups.

Once completed, the project will provide evidence that health systems and other stakeholders need to implement interventions to prevent unsafe opioid prescribing.","1. Patient Participants

NCT04607473,ABUS for Early-stage Breast Cancer,Early Stage Breast Cancer,automated breast ultrasound (ABUS),INTERVENTIONAL,,"While the role of automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) as an alternative to hand-held ultrasound (HHUS) in breast cancer screening has been established, the use of ABUS in preoperative evaluation of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients is still limited. This may be because axillary areas are not included in the scanning area of ABUS. Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients have undergone axillary US to predict axillary lymph node metastasis before surgery, in combination with preoperative breast US, in many institutions. However, recent studies have reported that sentinel lymph node biopsy alone is sufficient for diagnosis and treatment of axillae of patients with early-stage breast cancer, because the incidence of axillary lymph node metastasis is very low. Therefore, the clinical significance of preoperative axillary US is being lowered in patients with early-stage breast cancers. Thus, considering that coronal images provided by ABUS may be more advantageous for detection of multifocal or multicentric cancer, we hypothesized that ABUS could replace HHUS in preoperative staging of patients with early-stage breast cancers (clinical Tis, T1-2/N0 cancers) for whom preoperative axillary US is not necessary. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the diagnostic performances of ABUS and HHUS in preoperative evaluation of patients with early-stage breast cancers. This study will be conducted with institutional review board approval, and written informed consent will be obtained. From the Jan 2019 to Dec 2021, 675 patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer will be enrolled from the three institutions. Both ABUS and HHUS will be performed on each patient before surgery. Breast radiologists independently review ABUS and HHUS images. They detect all visible lesions and record the location and size of them. They characterize all detected lesions by using BI-RADS category. The primary object is to compare the diagnostic performance of ABUS and HHUS as preoperative staging tool in women with known breast cancers. The sensitivities and specificity of each US mode for the detection of breast cancers are calculated on a per-lesion basis. McNemar's test and Fisher's exact test are used to compare the sensitivities and PPVs for ABUS and HHUS. Significance testing on the lesion level and patient level is conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with a logit link and an independent working correlation structure to adjust the effect of clustering on radiologists and patients. GEEs are utilized to compare the sensitivities and PPVs for ABUS and HHUS. Diagnostic performance are assessed with receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Area under the curves are calculated from both parametric and trapezoidal curve fitting. Agreements between tumor size measured by each US mode and pathologic the tumor size are analyzed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% Bland-Altman limits of agreement.","Inclusion Criteria:

Patients with lung cancer in surgical and medical departments are at high risk of VTE development. Prophylaxis is one major way to to prevent it. Currently, VTE prophylaxis is mainly based on VTE-risk assessment. However, all patients hospitalized for cancer are at intermediate or high risk of VTE but their bleeding risk vary. To improve effect of VTE prophylaxis and reduce bleeding events in patients with lung cancer, we will conduct an open-label parallel randomized clinical tria to assess the effect of bleeding risk based prophylaxis strategy among lung cancer patients. We hypothesize that VTE prophylaxis based on bleeding risk assessment with a short post-discharge treatment course is superior to VTE propohylaxis based on VTE risk assessment among hospitalized patients with lung cancer

A sample of 3200 eligible patients will be randomized into experimental or control group with an allocation rate of 1:1. Stratified by medical/surgical units, block randomization with a varying block size of 4 or 6 will be adopted to randomize patients into experimental or control group. In experimental group, patients will undergo bleeding risk assessment and receive prophylaxis according to bleeding risk during hospitalization, and they will also receive an extended pharmacological prophylaxis of 5mg Rivaroxaban once daily for up to 15 consecutive days after discharge. In control group, patients will receive routine VTE prophylaxis, VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis if indicated during hospitalization according to current policies for hospitals in China but no further treatment prophylaxis after discharge.

Patients in both groups will be followed up for 30 days.

NCT01906073,Nasal Fentanyl for Chronic Cancer Pain,"Cancer, Pain","intranasal fentanyl spray, slow release morphine",INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,"Today, patients with cancer pain in need of opioids for moderate to severe pain get long-acting morphine twice a day and morphine tablets taken on demand in addition. This procedure might be based on the assumption that cancer pain is persistent, although the evidence to support whether this assumption applies to all cancer patients is lacking. Some cancer patients might not need a fixed dose of long-acting morphine.

Because of rapid pain relief, the new fentanyl drugs open for the possibility to take an opioid on demand when pain occurs.

A pilot study where 10 patients with cancer pain were treated with a rapid-acting fentanyl nasal spray taken on demand, showed that this treatment was apparently feasible and safe for these patients.

This approach is studied further in NFCP-II. The participants will be treated with rapid-acting fentanyl nasal spray and long-acting morphine in a crossover study. The primary outcome will be patient satisfaction.

The study will consist of a test dose of nasal fentanyl, a dose-finding phase and a treatment phase with either nasal fentanyl taken on demand or slow-released morphine taken twice a day. After 10 days of treatment there is a crossover and the opposite drug is used for the same participant. Morphine tablets can be taken on demand in all phases of the study.

The participants will meet the investigator at inclusion, at the crossover and at the end of treatment. During the study, a diary is filled in by the participants every morning. Questions about pain and side effects are answered. Satisfaction is measured at the crossover and at end of treatment while preference is measured at the end of treatment.","Inclusion Criteria:

The approach suggested here is to deplete and active the immune response of these patients. The combination of Toripalimab and Vinorelbine would provide a higher gain in anti-tumor response in these patients than in those with chemotherapy alone.

The investigators proposal is to conduct a multicentric, single arm, Phase II trial in HER2- patients with metastatic breast cancer, aiming to evaluate the clinical activity of the combination therapy Toripalimab + metronomic Vinorelbine.

NCT01666431,Single-center Investigator Initiated Pilot Study Investigating the Tumor Response of Squamous Cell Carcinoma Lesions in Patients Under Lapatinib Treatment,Squamous Cell Carcinoma,Lapatinib,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are epithelial carcinomas with a high frequency of EGF-R expression. EGFR is an important regulator of tumour progression and proliferation in several types of cancer. Mechanism of action of Lapatinib in the EGFR and/or HER2 expressing oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells is attributed to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Based on the data from oesophageal SCCs the investigators hypothesise that EGFR signalling pathway and its interactions play an important role in the SCC pathogenesis and represent a good therapeutic target from these tumours.

Primary Objectives:

To evaluate the tumour response macroscopically in patients with primary cutaneous SCC lesions and in concomitant SCC in situ (AK).

Secondary Objectives:

NCT05228431,Modified Sandwich Therapeutic Regimen for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer,Advanced Rectal Cancer,"XELOX, Capecitabine monotherapy, Radiation",INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"In the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer, the short-term and long-term efficacy of the traditional sandwich regimen has not reached satisfactory efficacy. For this reason, the concept of reducing the dose of postoperative chemotherapy or directly moving forward the full amount of postoperative chemotherapy was proposed, which is called total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT). However, TNT also includes the high toxicity of oxaliplatin in the whole process and the long time interval between the end of radiotherapy and the operation, which leads to fibrosis of the surrounding tissue, which increases the difficulty of surgical resection and makes it difficult to ensure good surgical specimen quality. In addition to this, there are issues that may increase the risk of potential disease progression in patients with poor treatment withdrawal. Therefore, appropriately reducing the intensity of chemotherapy and controlling the total duration of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy during radiotherapy is expected to alleviate the side effects of neoadjuvant therapy. Here, the investigators synthesized the characteristics of TNT and sandwich regimens and proposed a XELOX regimen and capecitabine alternate administration combined with preoperative intensity modulated radiation therapy.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT03030131,Immune Neoadjuvant Therapy Study of Durvalumab in Early Stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",Durvalumab,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer related-deaths worldwide, with an overall all-stage 5-year survival of approximately 17%. The primary treatment of early stage (I-IIIA) NSCLC is curative surgery. Although patients treated with curative surgery have a better prognosis, the 5-year survival for patients treated with surgery alone remains low, ranging from 67% (stage IA) to 23% (stage IIIA). Several randomized trials comparing postoperative chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy have shown a significant overall survival benefit from postoperative chemotherapy in completely resected patients with NSCLC stage II and IIIA. Likewise other randomized trials have demonstrated preoperative chemotherapy improves survival and recently the analyses also based on individual patients data of 15 randomized trials showed a significant benefit of preoperative chemotherapy on survival with the same survival improvement of 5% at 5 years. Then, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has also become accepted in many countries.

Targeting of PD-1 receptors and its ligand PD-L1, and inhibiting their engagement is an attractive therapeutic option in the early stage NSCLC, which may reactivate host immune responses and enable longterm tumor control.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT05592873,Oncological Impact of Lateral Nodes in Rectal Cancer,Colorectal Adenocarcinoma,Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT),OBSERVATIONAL,,"The combination of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and total mesorectal excision (TME) is considered the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer in the western world. Appropriate preoperative treatment and margin free surgery are key-elements in reducing the local-recurrence of the tumor and consequently improving overall survival.

Nevertheless, the local recurrence of stage II and III rectal cancer is still high, with current levels of 5% to 10% even when R0 resection is achieved. Most of the cases of loco-regional recurrence are associated with lateral lymph nodes (LLN) spread of cancer cells, which is not always controlled by the preoperative chemotherapy. As a matter of fact, the incidence of LLD metastases has been estimated to range from 11% to 22% in patients with T3/4 rectal cancer below the peritoneal reflection.

In order to improve these poor outcomes, Japanese surgeons have adopted extended lymphadenectomy with the dissection of lateral extramesorectal lymph nodes as the standard of care for T2-3 low rectal cancer patients5. While this approach is widely used in Japan and Korea, western surgeons have preferred a less aggressive approach, indicating lateral lymph node dissection (LLND) only in presence of clinically highly suspicious lateral pelvic lymph nodes on baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thus, it is essential to identify preoperative predictive factors of LLN metastasis.

Even if MRI is considered the optimal diagnostic tool in rectal cancer, its accuracy for LLN staging is considered poor, especially after neoadjuvant treatment. LLNs often change in both features and size after CRT, and this behaviour might not be in concordance with the response of the primary tumor.

To the best of our knowledge, no consensus exists on whether the risk of local recurrence should be determined by assessing the features of LLN on the primary MRI or on the restaging MRI. Moreover, the relation between LLN response and primary tumor regression grade after neoadjuvant CRT needs to be thoroughly explored.

This multicenter cohort study aimed to investigate factors on primary and restaging MRI associated with lateral nodal recurrence and to identify patients who may benefit from LLND after neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer.","Inclusion criteria

NCT06039631,Neoadjuvant Chemoimmunotherapy Followed By Radiation Or Organ Preservation Surgery In Laryngeal/Hypopharyngeal Cancer,"Larynx Cancer, Hypopharyngeal Cancer","Surgery, Radiation, Toripalimab",INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"In the global landscape of cancer, head and neck malignancies are highly prevalent, with 878,000 new cases and 444,000 deaths recorded in 2020. Notably, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers contribute to around 30% of these instances. More than 50% of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced disease, necessitating intensive treatments that significantly impact their quality of life. Despite these efforts, the prognosis for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers remains grim, with a 5-year survival rate of 30% to 50%.

Past approaches focused on preserving laryngeal function and patient well-being, including minimally invasive surgery, advanced radiotherapy, and induction chemotherapy. Our prior research highlighted the effectiveness of combining toripalimab-based induction therapy and chemotherapy, followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy or surgery. Positive short-term outcomes and manageable side effects were observed, with encouraging larynx preservation rates after one year.

Against this backdrop, the current study aims to explore neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer. It seeks to compare the therapeutic efficacy and quality of life impacts of concurrent radiochemotherapy and organ-preserving surgery. The ultimate goal is to identify optimal strategies for future interventions.","Inclusion Criteria:

Development of targeted therapies in the context of precision medicine changed the way lung cancer was diagnosed and treated. Small molecule inhibitors, like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), are now standard first-line therapy for EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). First-generation EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib bind competitively to the ATP-binding site of EGFR TK domain. This binding in second-generation TKI afatinib is irreversible. These drugs have improved better outcome compared to standard conventional chemotherapy In spite of this, more than half of the patients with an EGFR TKI treatment develop resistance. Deletion in exon 19 and single point substitution L858R in exon 21 accounting for 44% and 41% of all EGFR mutations, respectively are the most common mutations in EGFR gene which cause this resistance in the patients. Asia has the highest prevalence of EGFR mutations (38.4%), followed by America (24.4%) and Europe (14.1%).

NCT04575831,"Exercise, Nutrition, and Palliative Care in Advanced Lung Cancer (ENPAL)",Advanced Lung Cancer,"Exercise, Nutrition, and Palliative Symptom Management",INTERVENTIONAL,,"Background: Evidence supports exercise and nutrition as beneficial for enhancing QOL in earlier stages of lung cancer; however, there is minimal research of either intervention - and none with combined interventions - in advanced lung cancer patients. In addition to a multimodal intervention approach that includes nutrition and exercise, consideration of advanced cancer care symptom management is crucial for optimizing the potential benefits of either intervention.

Objectives: Primary outcome measure of this study is feasibility, including recruitment (% who participate from those eligible), attendance (weekly group class), assessment completion, safety (adverse event reporting), attrition rates, and qualitative themes generated from one-on-one participant interviews. The secondary outcome to be measured is the impact of the intervention on PROs, including QOL, fatigue and symptom burden, as well as self-reported physical activity levels and physical function assessed in-person.

Methods: The proposed exercise intervention will include a centre-based group exercise program plus home-based exercises, and behaviour change support for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, classified as stage III or IV with self-reported symptom burden. Eligible participants must be cleared by the health care professionals (HCP) to engage in mild to moderate levels of physical activity (PA). Using a prospective, mixed-methods design (supported by the Medical Research Council guidance for the evaluation of complex interventions), the quantitative component of this pilot study will measure feasibility and exploratory outcome measures, with an embedded qualitative component to examine participant perspectives about study tolerability/feasibility of the intervention. A subset of participants and instructors will be recruited for qualitative interviews using purposive sampling to achieve maximum variation based on factors that may lead to different viewpoints (e.g., age, gender, lung cancer type/stage, treatment).

Relevance: The proposed work will inform the design of a future pragmatic trial for this population. The goal is to build a patient-focused model of care that delivers wellness resources for advanced lung cancer care that will ultimately improve the patients' health and QOL. This approach is novel, patient-focused, and will build a tailored approach within existing resources to deliver optimal care.","Inclusion Criteria:

Prognosis and treatment are dependent on the expression of estrogen receptors (ER) in the tumor. ER status is determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on biopsy tissue. The ER expression can change over time and be heterogeneous.

The IHC score on ER expression is subjective and can lead to intra and inter observer variability. A new computer image analysis software that can give the exact percentage of colored tumor cells on sectional tumor cuts has been developed.

It is also possible to quantify the ER expression non invasive by using the tracer 16α-18F-flour-17β-estradiol (FES) and in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) scans. FES-PET/CT has a high background activity in the liver which complicates the visualization of liver metastases. Theoretically, a new whole body parametric scan method makes it possible to distinguish background activity from uptake in liver metastases.

Malignant tumors often have an increased perfusion, and previous studies have found that tumors with low metabolism relative to blood flow have the longest disease free survival (DFS). To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the correlation between ER expression and blood flow.","Inclusion Criteria:

The role of physical activity to counteract these side effects is acknowledged. However, cancer patients are often misinformed about the potential benefits of physical therapy during cancer therapy. In this context, the role of therapeutic patient education seems essential.

Because of lack of time, therapeutic patient education (TPE) is often provided via an information booklet. However, the investigators assume that a face-to-face interview results in a greater impact on patient's behavior change (the level of physical activity during cancer therapy, in our case). This research project is designed to challenge this hypothesis.

NCT00155727,Comparison of Laparoscopic Colectomy Versus Open Colectomy for Colorectal Cancer: … A Prospective Randomized Trial,Colorectal Cancer,,OBSERVATIONAL,,"The laparoscopic colectomy has been enthusiastically used by many colorectal surgeons in Taiwan, Japan, Europe, and USA, for around 10 years. Further clarification of the controversies cited above will be based on the evidence-based medicine, i.e., the randomized, well-controlled, prospective clinical trials. Actually, a handful of randomized prospective data regarding the laparoscopic colectomy has been appeared in USA and Europe. However, we still do not have this kind of data in Taiwan, and therefore this study is important and mandatory.

In this project, we assumed that a difference in cancer-related survival of less then 15% between treatments indicates an equivalent efficacy. Assuming a 70% 5-year, cancer-related survival of stage II and III colorectal cancer patients in the open colectomy group, a minimum of 100 patients per group was required to showed that both surgical techniques were equivalent with an α-level of 0.20 and a β error of 0.05. Only patients with stage II and III disease undergoing curative resection will be enrolled onto this study. The patients will be randomly allocated to either treatment group by block randomization method. Postoperatively, the patients will be prospectively evaluated regarding the following parameters including operative stress, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum interleukin-6, WBC counts and classification, CD-4 to CD-8 ratio, postoperative life quality, such as wound size, degree of pain, time to have flatus passage and feeding, time to resume daily activity and work, and the oncological outcomes, such as recurrence patterns of tumor, and 5-year patient survival. The evaluation of above-mentioned parameters will be single-blindly done by our research assistant, who has no idea of both surgical techniques.

NCT06406673,A Phase II Clinical Study of Cadonilimab in Treatment-naïve or Relapsed Extensive Small Cell Lung Cancer,Extensive Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Cadonilimab+EC/ET+RT, Cadonilimab+vorolanib",INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of lung cancer cases and is an aggressive cancer characterized by rapid growth, early metastasis, and a poor prognosis. Approximately 75% of SCLC patients present with extensive-stage disease at the time of diagnosis, which is classically defined as a disease that cannot be encompassed by a single radiation field. Before the era of immunotherapy, the standard first-line therapy for ES-SCLC was platinum-based chemotherapy with etoposide; Once complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) was achieved after chemotherapy, consolidative thoracic radiation was recommended. Despite this standard treatment, the median overall survival (OS) of ES-SCLC is about 8-11 months, which has not changed for about 40 years. Combining concurrent radiotherapy of the thorax and immunochemotherapy may have a synergistic effect.

Besides, for patients with recurrent SCLC, topotecan remains the only approved second-line treatment, and the outcomes are poor. With the most recent approval of EP plus a programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1) inhibitor, there are now more therapeutic options for managing ES-SCLC.The best second-line therapy after combination of chemo-immunotherapy is not well defined, as many second-line therapies were studied only after use of EP. However, second-line treatment options for patients with relapsed ES-SCLC are limited and include reintroduction of EP (with or without an immunotherapy), lurbinectedin, and topotecan.

Therefore, we designed this trial to explore the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab as second-line therapy for ES-SCLC. We present a safety profile and a final analysis of ORR.

In this single-center phase 2 trial, Cohort_1 patients with no history of previous systemic treatment for ES-SCLC received cadonilimab with EC/EP for two cycles (induction phase), then, those who did not progress received concurrent palliative RT and two cycles of cadonilimab with EC/EP (combination phase). Afterward they received cadonilimab every 3 weeks for a maximum of 2 years after study enrolment (maintenance phase). Cohort_2 patients with recurrent SCLC and after at most one systemic treatment received cadonilimab plus vorolanib, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

NCT03447431,Aberrant Splicings Due to Microsatellite Instability in Colorectal Cancer : Physiopathological and Clinical Impact,"Colorectal Cancer, Microsatellite Instability",,OBSERVATIONAL,,"MSI (Microsatellite Instability) colorectal cancer (CRC) show improved survival, are less prone to metastasis and show poor response to chemotherapy (compared to MSS tumors). The underlying reasons for these characteristics are still not understood and no specific therapeutic approach for MSI colon tumours (15% of CRC overall) has yet been developed.

The MSI process is oncogenic when it affects DNA repeat sequences that have a functional role, e.g. Small Coding Repeats (SCR). MSI also frequently affects Long Non-Coding Repeats (LNCR) in tumour DNA. In contrast to SCR, only a few LNCR are endowed with biological activity. Consequently, this area has received very little attention. Our group recently identified HSP110 mutant chaperone protein in MSI CRC that was generated by somatic deletion of a LNCR. Of interest, HSP110 mutant (due to exon skipping) have anti-oncogenic properties and the survival of MSI CRC patients receiving chemotherapy is positively associated with HSP110 mutations in tumour DNA.

The aim of the current project is to identify additional clinically relevant MSI-associated splicing aberrations due to mutations in LNCR located in splice acceptor sites. The four main steps are as follows:

1. To identify exon/intron sites affected by aberrant splicing events due to MSI in CRC . All RNASeq data will be exploited to identify recurrent splicing aberrations (mostly exon skipping) that occur specifically in MSI colon tumours;
2. To investigate for possible functional links between MSI and any detected aberrant splicing events . All specific aberrant splicing events detected by RNAseq in MSI CRC samples will be first confirmed (quantitative RT-PCR) in order to eliminate false positive cases. For validated exon candidates, the allelic profiles of adjacent intronic LNCR will be analysed (PCR and fluorescence genotyping) in CRC cell lines and primary tumours (MSI and MSS), as well as in matching normal mucosa samples in order to assess their polymorphic status;
3. To identify splicing events and LNCR mutations with clinical relevance in MSI CRC patients . All LNCR with a confirmed role in gene splicing in MSI CRC will be analysed. The clinical relevance of candidate genes will be assessed using multivariate survival regression models for Relapse- Free Survival, with interaction terms (response to chemotherapy);
4. To initiate functional studies on a limited number of clinically relevant, cancer-related genes whose splicing is perturbed in MSI cancer cells, and to develop biological tools to simplify screening in future clinical assays Similar to HSP110, we will focus on 4 or 5 mutant proteins that are promising drug therapeutic targets. Functional assays will be developed to further elucidate their role in the pathophysiology of MSI tumours. We also aim to develop biological tools for these candidate genes, such as the detection of wild-type or mutant proteins by immunohistochemistry.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT06166173,Using Color Doppler US Artifact to Identify Tumor Markers,"Breast Cancer, Interventional Radiology, Doppler Ultrasound",,OBSERVATIONAL,,"Before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in cases of locally advanced breast cancer, malignant masses in the breast and biopsy-proven tumor involvement axillary lymph nodes are marked with metallic markers. The primary objective of this marking is to establish the precise localization of the tumor which response to NACT partial or completely. However, selecting the marker with ultrasound (US) proves challenging in many instances. Research studies indicate that patients with occult markers are observed at a frequency of 24%. Some studies propose that the twinkling artifact serves as a reliable method for accurately indicating the localization of certain tumor markers. This artifact is deemed particularly helpful for lesions situated in the axilla or posterior of the breast, which may not be visible with US and are undetectable with mammography.

In the context of Color Doppler examination, the investigators have noted the presence of another color Doppler artifact which can aid in determining marker localization. When the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is reduced and the color gain is increased, color noise, termed as color confusion or blooming artifact/effect, is observed within the color steer. While this color confusion tends to mask healthy tissues, it has been observed that the tumor marker remains unaffected by the blooming effect. Consequently, this artifact serves to distinctly reveal the borders and localization of the tumor marker.

In some studies, it has been stated that the twinkling artifact, which is a color Doppler artifact and whose mechanism is not fully understood, is a reliable method to accurately indicate the localization of some tumor markers. It has been reported that this artifact will be very helpful, especially in lesions located in the axilla or posterior of the breast, which cannot be seen with US and cannot be detected with mammography .

In Color Doppler examination, we saw that another color Doppler artifact, such as the twinkling artifact, could also be helpful in determining marker localization. When the PRF is reduced and the color gain is increased, color noise, which is selected as color confusion and can be called blooming artifact or blooming effect-like, is observed in all structures within the color steer. While healthy tissues are masked by this color confusion, the tumor marker is protected from the blooming effect. Thus, with this artifact, tumor marker borders and localization are clearly revealed.","Inclusion Criteria:

Advanced disease is often the result of tumour perforation and seeding of tumour cells within the peritoneal cavity. Complete cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CCRS HIPEC) is the current standard of care for PMP.

An Australian pharmaceutical company is developing BromAc for diseases involving mucin. This drug is composed of Bromelain and Acetylcysteine.

BromAc in combination have the ability, as shown in pre-clinical studies, to remove the mucin protective framework expressed by cancer including mucin (MUC) 1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC and MUC16. The sponsor has shown the mechanism of action of BromAc - to break peptide and glycosidic linkages and disulphide bonds in tumour produced and respiratory mucin. BromAc has been safe in preclinical development with a manageable adverse event profile and preliminary efficacy in a phase 1 study.

The development of Geriatric Oncology has greatly improved the management of older patients with the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessments (CGA) being conducted before cancer treatment. A CGA encompasses several dimensions such as comorbidities, but also functional, nutritional or cognitive domains. The International guidelines recommended establishing cooperation with pharmacists as part of the CGA in order to review prescriptions of older patients with cancer and to avoid adverse side effects of treatment. However, the CGA before starting oncological treatment offer is limited in France, especially in some regions which are less populated, or where access to medical centers are difficult. The main objective of our work is to evaluate the impact of telemedicine in geriatric oncology consultation of unexplained re-hospitalization rate at 3 months in the acute care unit. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of telemedicine on unexplained re-hospitalization rate at 6 months, on the secondary toxicities, on the postoperative complications in patients treated surgically, on the overall survival and on the acceptance of the pharmaceutical recommendations by the physicians, but also the impact of telemedicine in medico-economic terms and the satisfaction of patients and oncologists benefiting from teleconsultation.

It is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study involving 500 patients in 9 participating centers, including 6 peripheral hospitals. The experiment will be represented by the implementation of telemedicine in oncology centers where this expertise is not very available, allowing them to benefit from geriatric oncology teleconsultation and pharmaceutical tele-expertise carried out by three university hospitals. Patients recruited by oncologists, according to the inclusion criteria, will give their written consent to participate. Centers were randomized. In the control arm, patients will be treated according to the usual oncological management as defined for each type of cancer. In the interventional arm, patients will benefit from a CGA with a geriatric oncology teleconsultation as well as a pharmaceutical tele-expertise before the initiation of oncological treatment.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT01873131,A Clinical Trial of Pulsed-dye Laser Versus Timolol Topical Solution Versus Observation on the Growth of Hemangioma in Newborn,Hemangioma,"topical timolol maleate, Pulsed dye laser",INTERVENTIONAL,,"The purpose of this study is to find out if pulsed dye laser treatment or timolol maleate 0.5% gel can help infants who have a hemangioma. The investigators also want to find out if pulsed dye laser treatment and timolol maleate 0.5% gel are safe to use without causing too many side effects.

Hemangioma is a common type of birthmark. These birthmarks happen when many new blood vessels grow in a specific area on the skin. Blood vessels are tiny tubes that carry blood through the body. No one knows what causes blood vessels to group together. Most birthmarks don't hurt at all and they usually aren't a sign of any kind of illness. Lots of newborns have these birthmarks on their bodies, like between the eyebrows. These birthmarks usually disappear within the first few months to years of life. These birthmarks tend to disappear spontaneously. Most hemangiomas are not treated unless the hemangioma threatens the child's health, which occurs in about 1 in 3 children with hemagiomas.

Pulsed dye laser is widely used in children, and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating hemangioma.

The FDA has approved timolol maleate to treat glaucoma in adults, but the FDA has not approved timolol maleate to treat hemangiomas in children. About 7 infants with hemangiomas have received timolol maleate. The results so far show that timolol maleate may be helpful and safe in treating hemangiomas in infants.

An important question being tested in this study is whether pulsed-dye laser or timolol maleate can prevent hemangioma from growing when used very early after birth.","Inclusion Criteria:

1. Subjects aged less than 3 months, male or female.

NCT05630131,ctDNA in Subjects With Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer Treated With Trimodality Therapy,"Bladder Cancer, Muscle-Invasive Bladder Carcinoma",,OBSERVATIONAL,,"The purpose of this prospective biospecimen collection study is to evaluate the feasibility of measuring circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in subjects with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) treated with trimodality therapy consisting of a maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor followed by radiation and concomitant chemotherapy.

Cancer cells have unique genes that determine the characteristics of tumors, such as how they will respond to different treatments. The tumor tissue will be used to determine the genes present in cancer cells. Tumor cells sometimes release fragments of DNA into the blood or urine (circulating tumor DNA or ctDNA) and measuring levels of ctDNA may be a way to monitor cancer and predict to determine which treatment works better and what will be the outcome of cancer.

Urine, blood, and tumor tissue are called biospecimens. Biospecimens can help researchers understand how the human body works. Researchers may develop new tests to monitor diseases or new ways to treat diseases. Plasma and urine specimens will be collected before, during, and after the standard-of-care treatment.

This study will estimate the feasibility of collecting plasma ctDNA detection in subjects with MIBC. If this information can be successfully collected and processed, the usefulness of ctDNA to predict tumor response to certain kinds of treatment or disease progression will be evaluated.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT04737031,Improving Tobacco Treatment Rates for Outpatient Cancer Patients Who Smoke,"Cancer, Smoking, Tobacco Use, Nicotine Dependence","Clinician Nudge, Patient Nudge",INTERVENTIONAL,,"The main purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ""nudges"" to clinicians, to patients, or to both in increasing Tobacco Use Treatment Service (TUTS) referral and engagement; and to explore clinician, patient, inner setting (e.g., clinic), and outer setting (e.g., payment structures) mechanisms related to TUTS referral and engagement. The investigators will employ rapid-cycle approaches to optimize the framing of nudges to clinicians and patients prior to initiating the trial and mixed methods to explore contextual factors and mechanisms.

The investigators will conduct a four-arm pragmatic cluster randomize clinical trial to test the effectiveness of nudges to clinicians, nudges to patients, or nudges to both in increasing TUTS referral and engagement in cancer patients who smoke, vs. usual care (UC). The investigators hypothesize that each of the implementation strategy arms will significantly increase TUTS referral and engagement compared to UC and that the combination of nudges to clinicians and to patients will be the most effective.","Inclusion Criteria:

Clinician participants must meet the following criteria for inclusion:

1. Currently in practice at an Implementation Lab site (UPHS)
2. Prescribing authority in Pennsylvania (i.e., physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant)
3. Cared for at least 1 tobacco-using patient in 30 days prior to recruitment
4. English-speaking (messages will be in English)

Patient participants must be diagnosed with cancer and report current tobacco smoking (as assessed by an by any staff collecting vital signs or initially rooming the patients such as nurses, front desk staff, MAs, nursing assistants or technicians during an Index Visit). Patients are considered in the analyzable dataset after their Index Visit and after they have a clinic visit with a clinician in the study at which point a nudge may have been delivered (see steps below).

The process by which patients become eligible for inclusion involves a 3-step algorithm employed in the EMR:

Step 1 - All patients seeking care within the participating Abramson Cancer Center programs are screened for tobacco use status in order to ascertain relevance to the project (i.e., tobacco exposure). This screening encounter need not be a visit with a clinician who is in the cluster randomization.

Step 2 - This step occurs at the first visit with a clinician within the cluster randomization. Note that this might be the same encounter in which screening occurs, but does not have to be. At this visit, all patients identified as current smokers are assigned a hidden (i.e., system) variable, the value of which is based on the clinician they are scheduled to meet during that visit (i.e., cluster membership).

Step 3 - The logic is engaged at the next (third in series) visit, wherein the system variable is used to guide the intervention based on the clinician's cohort. There must be this visit to permit the delivery of the nudges (or not, if in usual care arm). The primary outcome is clinician referral for tobacco cessation through the EHR at this visit. Thus, patients eligible for this study are only those who are screened (and positive for tobacco use) and have completed the two visits in their randomly assigned cluster (clinician clusters are the unit of randomization) during the study period.

NCT03781531,Identification of Novel Biomarkers to Aid in the Detection of Occult Cancer in Patients With Venous Thromboembolism,"Cancer, Venous Thromboembolism",,OBSERVATIONAL,,"Venous thromboembolism is a common and serious complication in cancer, and is associated with a substantially increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, VTE may be the earliest sign of cancer. Recent studies, however, fail to show a clinical benefit of extended cancer screening in this patient population. Better risk prediction models are therefore warranted to identify VTE patients who would benefit from a rapid and extensive cancer screening. Inflammation and hypercoagulability are considered hallmarks of cancer, and emerging light is being shed on the potential of various markers of inflammation and coagulation in cancer diagnostics and prognostics. Among the inflammatory and thrombotic processes linked to cancer is the neutrophil release of web-like nuclear chromatin (DNA and histones), referred to as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Driven by the tumor environment, NETs have recently been shown to play a central role in tumor progression, metastasis, and tumor-associated thrombosis.

The investigators hypothesize that an enhanced inflammatory state may be predictive of an underlying cancer in patients presenting with VTE. The present study is an ongoing prospective study with the primary aim to investigate the diagnostic potential of markers of inflammation, including markers of NETs, in detecting occult cancer in patients presenting with VTE. Secondary aims are to include other biomarkers of cancer, and to assess whether any or a combination of these biomarkers may be prognostic of occult cancer, recurrent thrombotic events, mortality, or cancer disease progression in VTE patients with an underlying malignancy.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT00001873,The Role of Cyclosporine in Blood Cell Transplants With T-Cell Add-Back for Blood Cancers,"Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Graft vs Host Disease, Hematologic Neoplasm, Multiple Myeloma, Myelodysplastic Syndrome",Isolex 300i plus MoAbs,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"Cancers of the blood, sometimes referred to as hematologic malignancies, are disorders of bone marrow cells that lead to the failure of the normal function of bone marrow and the uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells in the bone marrow. These cancerous cells can spill over into the bloodstream and affect other organs causing widespread symptoms. The disease is life threatening because it blocks the normal function of the marrow, which is to produce red cells (preventing anemia), white cells (preventing infection), and platelets (preventing progression).

Bone marrow transplants are a potential form of therapy for patients with hematologic malignancies. However, BMT is a complicated procedure and can be associated with dangerous side effects.

In this study researchers are attempting to find ways to reduce the complications of BMT, so that it would be possible to use it more safely and can be offered more patients. In order to do this, researchers are developing new techniques to make BMT safer. It requires making small changes to the standard procedure, which may improve the outcome.

The experimental procedures researchers are evaluating are:

1. \<TAB\>T-cell depleted peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation
2. \<TAB\> Cyclosporine given immediately after the transplant
3. \<TAB\>Add-back of donor lymphocytes

Patients undergoing these experimental techniques must be monitored closely to see if any benefit or harmful effects will occur. Information gathered from this study can be used to develop further research studies and potential new therapies for hematologic malignancies.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA - Patient:

Eligible participants are adults with cancer for whom weekly therapy with IV paclitaxel at a dose of 80 mg/m2 over 1 hour is indicated.

Stage 1 will consist of an initial cohort (Cohort 1) up to 6 evaluable participants who will receive a dosing regimen of Oraxol consisting of a 15-mg oral HM30181AK-US tablet plus an oral paclitaxel dose of 205 mg/m2, both administered once daily for 3 consecutive days. The stages and cohorts are further described in the ""Study Design - Stages and Cohorts"" table below. An interim analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Cohort 1 will be conducted to determine if the administered regimen would appear likely to achieve bioequivalence(BE) (AUC0-∞), if tested in a greater number of participants in Stage 2. If it appears unlikely that the selected regimen will meet the criteria for BE based on AUC0-∞ data, a second cohort (Cohort 2) of up to 6 evaluable participants may be enrolled in Stage 1, and the dose of paclitaxel in Oraxol may be adjusted by a maximum of +/- 25%. If Cohort 2 is enrolled, a second interim analysis will be conducted.

Vascular bypass surgery in children differs significantly from adults. It is a rarely performed procedure in the setting of trauma and tumor surgery to facilitate limb salvage. Beside the technical challenges to reconstruct the small and spastic vessels, bypass grafting should not impede growth of the extremity. The primary aim of this study was to assess long-term outcome after pediatric bypass grafting, in a single academic center, focusing on potential effects on limb development.

Methods:

In this retrospective cohort analyses we included all pediatric patients undergoing vascular bypass grafting at the Medical University of Vienna between 2002-2017. All patients ≤ 18 years suffered a traumatic injury or underwent a tumor resection of the lower or upper limb, respectively.

NCT05081531,AI for Head Neck Cancer Treated With Adaptive RadioTherapy (RadiomicART),Head and Neck Cancer,Adaptive Radiotherapy,INTERVENTIONAL,,"Current clinical management algorithms for squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC) involve the use of surgery and / or radiotherapy (RT) depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Radical RT, exclusive or in combination with systemic therapy, represents an effective therapeutic option according to the international guidelines. Despite the recent technological advancements in the field of RT, about 30-50% of patients will develop locoregional failure after primary treatment . Moreover, although the development of Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) techniques allowed a greater sparing of dose on healthy tissues, radiation-induced toxicity still represents a relevant concern, impacting on quality of life. The continuous effort of personalized medicine has the goal of improving patient's outcome, in terms of both disease's control and pattern of toxicity. Advanced imaging modalities appear to play an essential role in the customization of the radiation treatment as shown through the use of Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART) and radiomic. With ART we mean the adaptation of tumor volumes and surrounding organs at risk (OARs) to the shrinkage and patient emaciation during RT treatment. Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) includes techniques that allow knowledge of patient-specific anatomical variations informed by Image-guided radiotherapies (IGRTs) to feedback into the plan and dose-delivery optimization during the treatment course. Radiomic is the extraction of quantitative features from medical images to characterize tumor pathology or heterogeneity. Radiomic features extracted from medical images can be used as input features to create a machine learning model able to predict survival, and to guide treatment thanks to its predictive value in view of therapy personalization.

The combination of both ART and radiomic analysis could potentially be considered a further advance in the personalization of oncological treatments, and in particular for radiation treatments. For this reason, the investigators designed the present research project with the aim to prospectively evaluate a machine learning-based radiomic approach to predict outcome and toxicity of HNSCC patients treated with ART by mean of CT, MRI and PET-scan.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT04891731,Efficacy and Safety of Leuprorelin 3M in Premenopausal Women With Hormone Receptor-positive Breast Cancer,Hormone Receptor-positive Breast Cancer,AI or TAM,OBSERVATIONAL,,"Leuprorelin, a LHRH agonist, acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion and is commonly used for the treatment of hormone-responsive prostate cancer, premenopausal HR+ breast cancer, endometriosis and uterine fibroids. It is currently available in 1M, 3M, 6M for subcutaneous administration. Initially administration would stimulate an increase in LH and FSH, causing a transient increase of E2 in 2-4 weeks. Continuous administration results in a subsequent decrease in E2 levels, as a result of decreased levels of luteinizing LH and FSH. After stopping injection, ovarian function could gradually recover. Adverse events related to leuprorelin include flushing, mood swings and urogenital symptoms.

At present, the treatment of premenopausal breast cancer mainly includes 1M and 3M GnRHa. Leuprorelin 11.25mg dosage form is currently the only 3M GnRHa in China that has gotten breast cancer indications. The use of 3M GnRHa could improve patients' compliance and reduce injection discomfort. However, previous studies about GnRHa alone or in combination with TAM or AIs usually used 1M GnRHa.

NCT00923273,Sirolimus and Pemetrexed to Treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung","FDG-PET, Pemetrexed, Sirolimus, Vitamin B12, Folic acid tablets, Dexamethasone tablets",INTERVENTIONAL,"PHASE1, PHASE2","Background:

The drug pemetrexed is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that does not respond to standard therapy or that has recurred after standard therapy; however, only 9 in 100 patients respond to pemetrexed.

Sirolimus is a drug that blocks a protein in cells called mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In cancer cells, mTOR is active when it should not be, allowing the cells to grow uncontrollably. This protein is unusually active in many cases of NSCLC. By blocking the activity of mTOR, sirolimus may make the cancer cells more responsive to treatment with pemetrexed.

Objectives:

To determine if sirolimus in combination with pemetrexed is safe and well tolerated in patients with NSCLC.

To determine the highest safe dose of pemetrexed combined with sirolimus.

To look at the ability of sirolimus and pemetrexed to fight NSCLC.

To learn how the body eliminates sirolimus and pemetrexed.

Eligibility:

Patients 18 years of age and older with NSCLC whose disease does not respond to standard therapy or has recurred after treatment with standard therapy.

Design:

Biopsy before treatment starts, if the tumor is easy to reach by bronchoscopy or can be done by needle biopsy. This procedure is optional.

Drug treatment, as follows:

* Day 1: Intravenous (through a vein) infusions of pemetrexed. Small groups (3 to 6) of patients are given pemetrexed at a certain dose level. If the first group experiences no significant side effects, the next group receives a higher dose. This continues in succeeding groups for up to five dose levels until the maximum tolerated study dose (highest dose that patients can be given safely) is determined.
* To lessen the side effects of pemetrexed, patients also receive a Vitamin B12 injection every 21 days, folic acid tablets daily, and dexamethasone tablets twice a day the day before, the day of, and the day after pemetrexed infusions.
* Days 1-21: Sirolimus tablets by mouth.

Evaluations during the treatment period:

* History and physical examinations, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram.
* Disease evaluation with computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance scans (MRI) scans....","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

  1. Histologically documented non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology at the Clinical Center/National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Laboratory of Pathology at National Naval Medical Center (NNMC).
  2. Tumor biopsy will be requested from all study subjects unless the procedure poses too great a risk. If the subject declines, he or she may still participate in the study. We will ask subjects not undergoing biopsy to provide 6 unstained slides or a tissue block of archived tissue for immunohistochemistry (IHC) evaluation. Tumors from subjects enrolling in the phase II portion of the study will be analyzed retrospectively to demonstrate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation as assessed by immunohistochemistry in a fresh biopsy. mTOR activation will be defined using distribution and intensity of staining for phosphorylation of mTOR, or its downstream substrates S6 kinase (S6K), and S6. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) describing the acquisition and handling of PBMCs and tissues are outlined in appendix 10.3 and 10.4. At a minimum, a total score (sum of intensity and distribution scores) of 2 for phospho-S6 or phospho-mTOR (S2448) mTOR will be required to determine that mTOR is active. Either measurement will be sufficient to ascertain that mTOR is active. Measurement of phosphorylation of Akt, factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and total levels of thymidylate synthase (TS) will also be measured, but are not part of the eligibility requirements. In the event of limited tissue availability, the stains will be prioritized as follows: S6, mTOR, S6K, Akt (S473), Akt (T308), and TS. Phosphorylation of S6 correlates most closely with mTOR activity, while phosphorylation of mTOR at S2448 best predicts response to sirolimus.
  3. Tissue from the time of original diagnosis will be adequate for enrollment on study. Optional fresh tissue biopsy must be obtained AFTER their most recent chemotherapy (including small molecule or targeted therapy) or radiation therapy. Tumors that can be biopsied percutaneously (with or without computed tomography (CT)/ultrasound guidance) or via bronchoscopy will be considered accessible if there are no other competing risk factors such as coagulopathy, hypoxemia, unstable cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled pain, or inability to give informed consent.
  4. Individuals with relapsed NSCLC who have received at least one standard chemotherapeutic regimen are eligible. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and then relapse or recur less than or equal to 12 months after completion of chemotherapy will be eligible. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and relapse greater than 12 months after completion of chemotherapy should receive frontline therapy for metastatic disease before enrollment, as should individuals who initially present with incurable disease that is chemotherapy naive. Individuals unwilling to receive standard front line therapy for metastatic lung cancer may enroll.
  5. Patients must have not received any chemotherapy, biological, or radiation therapy in the 21 days prior to protocol enrollment. All previous chemo and radiation therapy induced toxicities must have resolved to grade 1 or less prior to enrollment.
  6. Because sirolimus may affect the efficacy of hormonal birth control via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4), study subjects of child bearing potential must be willing to use barrier birth control while receiving sirolimus therapy and for 12 weeks after discontinuation of sirolimus.
  7. Patients must have measurable disease for the phase II portion of the study.
  8. Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.
  9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0-2.
  10. An expected survival of at least 3 months.
  11. Patients must have the capacity to provide informed consent and demonstrate willingness to comply with an oral regimen.
  12. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

If the PRA shows \> 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained. The donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive. For those patients with an HLA class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained regardless of the PRA results. A positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion

NCT06195527,PEMBRO-K : Evaluation of Pembrolizumab Therapeutic Pharmacological Monitoring Benefit in NSCLC,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,,OBSERVATIONAL,,"Solid cancers and their therapeutic management remain a major public health problem due to their increasing prevalence and associated mortality. Among solid cancers, lung cancer ranks 4th among incident cancers. The prognosis remains poor, 33,117 deaths were recorded in France in 2018. Two histological forms of bronchopulmonary cancer are distinguished: non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), which represent 85% of bronchopulmonary cancer, and small cell lung cancers. The most common forms of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.

The emergence of new so-called targeted therapies has considerably modified the management and prognosis of oncology patients and in particular of patients with NSCLC. These new molecules were developed following the molecular characterization of tumors on the one hand and on the other hand the characterization of the role of immunity in anti-tumor defense, particularly the Programmed Death receptor pathway 1 (PD-1). Blocking this pathway restores the anti-tumor potential of these lymphocytes. Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with the Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PDL1) and Programmed Death Ligand-2 (PDL2), expressed by tumor cells but also by cells in the microenvironment. tumor and by antigen-presenting cells. Pembrolizumab thus potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumor responses, by blocking the binding of PD-1 with PDL1 and PDL2.

Pembrolizumab currently has marketing authorization (MA) for the treatment of NSCLC. Despite therapeutic progress due, among other things, to the emergence of anti-PD-1 antibodies including pembrolizumab, the prognosis of NSCLC remains poor and the use of pembrolizumab is sometimes limited by the occurrence of adverse effects.

The pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab was studied pre-marketing in patients with melanoma, NSCLC or metastatic or unresectable carcinomas. However, there are no data relating to the pharmacokinetic (PK) / clinical response (pharmacodynamic / PD) relationship of pembrolizumab, in real life. No prospective pharmacological study has in fact been published to date, especially in patients treated as part of the management of NSCLC. The absence of such studies - in real life - constitutes a pitfall given the existence of a possible association between PK data and the clinical response and/or toxicity of pembrolizumab.","Inclusion Criteria:

The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, it has on the body and on the prostate cancer. The immune cells (T cells) used in this study will be the patients own immune cells. They will be removed from the patients blood, changed in the laboratory, and then put back into their body. T cells help the body fight infections. These cells may also kill cancer cells in some cases. Right now the patients T cells are unable to kill the cancer cells. For this reason, the physician will change the T cells by putting in a gene so that they may be able to better recognize and kill the prostate cancer cells. A gene is a portion of information which comes from the DNA and tells the cell what to do. This gene will be put into the patients T cells by a weakened virus. It is hoped that this approach will help the T cells recognize the prostate cancer tumor cells and possibly kill them.

NCT01562431,The Signal-Trial: Evaluation of a Screening Tool for Psychosocial Problems in Cancer Genetics,"Psychosocial Issues, Cancer Genetics",Feed-back,INTERVENTIONAL,,"Background

An important part of individuals undergoing genetic counseling and/or testing for cancer experience psychosocial problems and worries during or after this process. Approximately 20% of these individuals experience serious problems, such as fear for cancer in themselves or their relatives, family communication problems, unresolved grief, problems in coping with the DNA-test-results, difficulties in choices with regard to DNA-testing, preventive surgeries, and concerns about insurance or work. Research shows that these problems are frequently undetected by the counselors. Within the limited available time of a counseling session, a lot of information should be given to the counselee. This information is mostly biomedical and provider driven. Therefore psychosocial issues can be underexposed. The use of a brief questionnaire, completed by the counselee prior to the counseling session, can serve as a tool for the counselor to screen and address the relevant psychosocial issues in a systematic manner. Therefore, in 2009-2010 the investigators have developed and validated the 'Signal-checklist' to identify relevant psychosocial problems frequently encountered in the cancer-genetics setting, and need for extra psychosocial services. This 'Signal-checklist' can serve as a tool in screening systematically for psychosocial issues, addressing these issues and directing appropriate referrals to extra psychosocial services. The Signal-Trial will be performed to evaluate the use and effectiveness of the checklist.

Aim

The aim of the trial is to evaluate the implementation of a short, self-developed cancer-genetics checklist; the 'Signal-checklist', as an aid in 1) facilitating communication on psychosocial issues during the genetic counseling session, 2) increasing counselors awareness of psychosocial problems of the counselee, and 3) improving the management of these psychosocial problems during and after the process of genetic counselling.

Method

This study is a collaboration between the family cancer clinics of the NKI-AVL and the UMCU. Individuals requesting genetic counseling for the high incidence of cancer in their family are invited to participate in the trial. Participants will be asked to complete the 'Signal checklist' prior to their counseling visit. Participants (N=264) will be randomly assigned to one of the two study arms. The intervention group will receive feed-back on the 'Signal-checklist', whereas the control group will not receive feed-back. Three weeks after the DNA-test disclosure session, participants will be asked to complete again the 'Signal-checklist' followed by a telephone call by their counselor. Again, the results of the 'Signal-checklist' will be available to the counselor for participants in the intervention group, but not for the control group. Both the genetic counseling session and telephone call will be audio taped. Furthermore, all participants will be asked to complete three questionnaires on the Internet (or by mail, if preferred); 1) before randomization (3 weeks prior to the counseling session), 2) three weeks after the counseling session, and 3) four months after the potential DNA-test result disclosure. These questionnaires include items on communication during genetic counseling, the need for professional psychosocial support, cancer worries, satisfaction with received care, and experiences with the use of the 'Signal-checklist'. The audio-tapes and completed questionnaires will be used to measure psychosocial problems of the counselees, the awareness of the counselors of these problems, and the management of these problems. Secondary analysis will be conducted to assess the need for extra psychosocial services, satisfaction with genetic counseling, feasibility of implementing the 'Signal-checklist' and decreasing psychosocial problems over time.","Inclusion Criteria:

* 18 years of age or older

15. Women who were breast feeding or pregnant as evidenced by positive serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin \[HCG\]).
16. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening and must have agreed to continue using such precautions for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or for 6 months after the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Non-sterilized male partners of a female subject must have used male condoms plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

    Female subjects should have also refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period described above.

    Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or post-menopausal.

    Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:
    * Females \<50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).
    * Females ≥ 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses \>1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses \>1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).

    Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening through 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or through 6 months after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Female partners (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of contraception.

    Male subjects should have refrained from sperm donation throughout the period described above.

    A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action \[excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective\]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).
17. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have put the subject at unacceptable risk.
18. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following the last durvalumab treatment or 6 months after the last tremelimumab treatment, whichever was longer.",104.0,phase 1 openlabel nonrandomized multicenter study durvalumab tremelimumab subjects advanced cancers eligible declined failed standard treatment primary study objective determine maximum tolerated dose mtd safety profile durvalumab tremelimumab combination secondary objectives evaluate pharmacokinetics pk immunogenicity durvalumab tremelimumab antitumor activity tumor response progressionfree survival pfs overall survival os durvalumab tremelimumab combination note collection pk immunogenicity samples removed amendment analysis done exploratory objectives evaluate biological activity durvalumab tremelimumab combination

NCT03561727,Risk Factors for Development of Incisional Hernia in Transverse Incisions,"Incisional Hernia, Malignancy","Mass closure technique, Layered closure technique",INTERVENTIONAL,,"RESEARCH PROJECT OBJECTIVES The aim of this planned study is to evaluate factors, with particular reference to surgical technique of abdominal closure, accumulation of advanced glycation end products, and collagen content in the transversalis fascia, that are associated with the development of incisional hernias after transverse epigastric incisions in patients operated due to malignant tumors.

RESEARCH PROJECT METHODOLOGY:

The study is designed as prospective and is planned to include 392 patients undergoing abdominal surgery due to malignant tumors of the alimentary system performed through transverse incisions in the epigastrium. Primary end-point of the study is defined as the occurrence of burst abdomen during immediate postoperative period or incisional hernia over 2 year postoperative follow-up. Assessment of the association between the type of surgical technique and development of hernia will be based on comparison of mass (1 layer) continuous suture and layered (2 layers) continuous suture using slowly absorbable material and applying suture to wound length ratio of more than 4. Type of the utilized surgical technique will be based on randomization. The method of abdominal closure will remain unknown for patients and investigators assessing the presence of incisional hernias. Assessment of overall collagen content and type I to type III ratio will be performed by obtaining a fragment of tissue during operation, preparation of formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded blocks, cutting of 4-micrometer thick sections, staining with picrosirius red and immunohistochemical procedures. Images will be analyzed with dedicated computer software. Accumulation of advanced glycation end products will be evaluated indirectly by measuring skin autofluorescence utilizing a method based on the use of photodiodes. Postoperative follow-up will include the period of postoperative hospitalization and two additional control visits at 1 and 2 years after the operation. Assessment of the presence of incisional hernia will comprise clinical examination, ultrasonographical study, and analysis of images from other available radiological studies. Irrespective of the primary end-point, additional analyses will be performed concerning associations between evaluated factors and occurrence of burst abdomen and the impact of incisional hernia on patients quality of life using the EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaires. Statistical analyses will, among other, include Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards regression and logistic regression","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT03133273,"Study of the Therapeutic Response and Survival of Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (stage IV) and Treated According to the Guidelines of a Chemosensitivity Test, Oncogramme® (ONCOGRAM)","Colorectal Cancer Metastatic, Chemotherapy",Oncogramme®,INTERVENTIONAL,,"Currently, chemotherapies are empirically administered to patients treated for colorectal cancer (CRC). Selection is based on the efficacy of a protocol previously determined on the largest number (consensus treatment), the decision-making process being weighted by patient's intrinsic criteria. However, each patient is unique, due to the inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity inherent in any cancer, partly explaining the unsatisfactory response rates observed for available chemotherapies. Functional sensitivity tests offer the possibility to adapt the treatment to each patient: they are based on an ex vivo study of the responses of the tumor cells (survival / death) to the different molecules / therapeutic combinations (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) likely to be administered to the patient. This response, translated into a tumor-specific sensitivity profile, can be used by the clinicians to determine the most appropriate therapeutic protocol. By increasing the therapeutic efficacy from the first line and reducing the deleterious side effects associated with multiple drug cycles, the sensitivity test transforms the consensus approach into personalized medicine, providing patients with improved progression free survival (PFS) associated with an improvement in the quality of life. Oncomedics has developed Oncogramme®, a CE-labeled in vitro diagnostic medical device that has already demonstrated the ability to predict chemosensitivity in a recent pilot study of metastatic CRC (prediction with 84% chance of success of tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy, vs. 50% maximum for chemotherapy administered according to the consensus method). The hypothesis that patients treated with a metastatic CRC for which systemic chemotherapy is adapted using Oncogramme® have better response rates, PFS and quality of life than patients treated according to usual practice, with optimization of the costs of care. To our knowledge, this is the only fully standardized test available, where each step and reagents of the procedure are mastered. The reliability of the procedure makes it possible to render a personalized result for each patient in 97% of the cases. In addition, the analysis is specifically centered on tumor cells using a method using fully defined, developed and validated media and reagents for each cancer, including CRC. The method of revealing the effect of the therapies identifies the proportion of dead cells in each condition, whatever their physiological state (proliferation / quiescence), by determining the percentage of living and killed cells, thus ensuring high sensitivity","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT04461873,The Effect of Reiki on the Stress Level of Caregivers of Cancer Patients,"Caregiver Stress Syndrome, Reiki, Caregiver Burnout","Reiki, Sham Reiki",INTERVENTIONAL,,"Stress caused by late-identified and unmet needs of caregivers negatively affect the physical and emotional health of patients and caregivers as well as their compliance with the treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the problems experienced by caregivers and to plan a number of attempts to reduce stress levels. Complementary and integrated practices for caregivers to manage their stresses are increasingly preferred approaches in recent years for many different reasons. One of these integrative practices, Reiki, is an energy therapy involving the use of energy that flows naturally from the hands of the practitioner to strengthen the body's ability to heal itself in order to increase well-being. This study was conducted using a pre-test and post-test, single-blind randomized controlled trial pattern and semi-structured in-depth interview method of qualitative research in order to evaluate the effect of Reiki on stress levels applied to individuals caring for cancer patients. The study comprised 42 women who were primary caregivers of cancer patients in total, as 21 women in Reiki group and 21 women in sham Reiki group. The approval of ethics committee, permissions from the institutions, and informed voluntary approval of the individuals were obtained to conduct the research. The data of the research were collected through the application of Caregiver Stress Scale (CSS), form for care giver's opinions on Reiki experience and application monitoring form including cortisol levels analyzed from saliva samples collected before and after application and measurements of pulse rate and blood pressure values. While Reiki group received reiki to 9 main points for 45 minutes per day for 6 weeks, in the sham Reiki group the same points were touched during the same period without starting energy flow. Caregiver Stress Scale (CSS) and salivary cortisol level were evaluated at the baseline and end of the study, whereas systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate were evaluated before and after application every week. At the end of the study, the opinions of the Reiki group on Reiki experience were collected by using a form consisting of semi-structured questions. The value of p\<0.05 was accepted statistically significant in the data analyses. Descriptive and content analysis methods were used to evaluate the qualitative data.","Inclusion Criteria:

Indeed, while many systems currently take a ""case-management"" approach to identify and address clinical care issues for high risk patients, no systems to our knowledge apply a risk-based approach that accounts both for adverse clinical outcome risk (e.g. breast cancer in a woman who has not had indicated screening for 4 years) and for clinical process risk (e.g. the likelihood that a specific patient will ignore a reminder letter and would therefore benefit from direct phone or in person contact). The investigators propose to directly test the hypothesis that implementing a health IT platform that 1) provides novel risk-based decision support using data derived from the electronic health record (EHR) and 2) leverages each clinician's unique knowledge of his or her patient panel will result in more effective and more efficient population-based primary care.

NCT04404673,Urinary and Sexual Dysfunctions Evaluation After Rectal Resection,Rectal Cancer,Evaluation of urinary and sexual dysfunction after rectal resection,OBSERVATIONAL,,"Advances in the treatment of rectal cancer over the past two decades have improved survival and significantly reduced surgery-related morbidity. As a result, post-treatment quality of life (QoL) issues have become increasingly important. Urinary and sexual functions can be significantly altered after rectal resection, mainly due to the iatrogenic lesions of the pelvic autonomous lexus. Of note, their incidence is reported up to 70% and 30%, respectively. Despite the importance of this topic, most of the studies present in the literature are difficult to interpret for a variety of reasons. Firstly, both sexual and urinary dysfunctions lack a standardized definition. Secondly, the absence of baseline data, missing data, small sample sizes, and heterogeneity in the use of validated and nonvalidated instruments are the main limitation in drawing conclusive results. As additional factor, no clear evidence is present in the literature regarding the best approach to be used in order to preserve as much as possible both the sexual and urinary functionalities and to guarantee, at the same time, an adequate and oncologically correct rectal resection. Moreover, no data are currently present regarding the impact of pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy on the urinary and sexual functionalities. The main objective of the investigator's prospective study will be to define in a subjective manner which technique (open, laparoscopic, robot-assisted and Ta-TME) will guarantee the best urinary and sexual outcomes after rectal resection (with or without pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy) for the treatment of rectal carcinomas.

Thus, the primary endpoint will the post-operative evaluation at 1, 6 months and 1 year of the urinary and sexual functions by means of specific questionnaires.

Secondary endpoints will be:

* to investigate which technique (open, robotic, laparoscopic and trans-anal total mesorectal excision (TaTME)) more favorably correlate with urinary and sexual functions after radiochemotherapy (NAD+);
* the comparison of both the urinary and sexual dysfunction incidence on the base of the distance of the rectal tumor from the anal verge and the evaluation of the best approach to be used (open, laparoscopic, TaTME or robot-assisted) in relation to the tumor height;
* the short- (postoperative morbidity and histopathological data) and long-term (overall and disease-free survival) outcomes comparison among the open, laparoscopic, TaTME and robotic rectal resection.","Inclusion Criteria:

According to the World Cancer Research Fund International, there were more than 2.25 million new cases of breast cancer in women in 2020. Although the modern treatment strategies, based on the complex care, which consists of surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted chemotherapy directed at specific cancer molecules have substantially reduced the risk of death due to breast cancer, their wide adoption results in the wider prevalence of cardiotoxicity, defined as either symptomatic heart failure, or asymptomatic contractile dysfunction. The occurrence of cardiotoxicity induced by anti-cancer therapies is estimated at 5-15%, and its development is the primary cause of therapy termination, which significantly reduces the probability of the efficacy of treatment. Several attempts have been made to determine the efficacious preventive strategy, which could diminish the risk of cancer-therapy induced cardiotoxicity. The results of the prior studies indicated a trend towards lower risk of troponin elevation, or left ventricular contractile dysfunction with the introduction of drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) axis, which constitute the primary treatment modality in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sacubitril/valsartan, the novel therapeutic agent, has been demonstrated to significantly improve prognosis in patients with HFrEF. Prior retrospective, small, single-center studies have shown that treatment with sacubitril/valsartan may reduce the risk of cancer-therapy induced cardiotoxicity, or reverse contractile dysfunction caused by anti-cancer therapy.

NCT04629027,Evaluation System for the Efficacy of Immunologic Checkpoint Inhibitors in NSCLC,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,Immune checkpoint inhibitor,OBSERVATIONAL,,"Inhibitors of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are effective therapies for metastatic NSCLC lacking sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations. First-line combination regimens that include a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor may maximize the chance of response and lead to prolonged survival. PD-L1 expression is the only validated predictive biomarker for selecting pembrolizumab treatment. However, it is far from being the ideal biomarker and its role in predicting efficacy from ICPIs remains undefined due to conflicting results from randomized clinical trials. The selection of patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapy is crucial in order to avoid exposure to potentially toxic and ineffective drugs as well as to prevent inappropriate allocation of health resources. Further studies are clearly needed to better understand the mechanism of action of immunotherapy in vivo thus allowing the identification of other predictive biomarkers. Therefore, our research team intends to explore advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, by combining the evaluation criteria of solid tumor efficacy evaluation criteria (RECIST1.1), clinical pathological characteristics of patients, and dynamic monitoring of peripheral blood molecular biological markers, finding the correlation with the efficacy of immunotherapy, establish a detection mode for selecting patients with clinical benefits.","Inclusion Criteria:
