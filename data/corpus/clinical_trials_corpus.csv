NCT04909073,Observational Study of Afatinib 30 mg Daily,"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation",Afatinib,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Afatinib, a first-in-class irreversible ErbB family blocker, is a 1st line treatment option for patients with advanced stage NSCLC harbouring sensitizing EGFR mutations. In randomized 1st line studies of afatinib at a standard dose of 40 mg daily versus standard of care, 28-53% of patients required a dose reduction due to adverse events (AE) induced by afatinib. The most common AEs are cutaneous and gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, dysphagia, and mucositis). Prevalence of diarrhoea in patients receiving 40 mg of afatinib, in 1st line phase II and III studies is as high as 90.0% (all grades of diarrhoea) and 14.4% (grade 3-4 diarrhoea). Another important gastrointestinal AE is mucositis, which presents in 51.9%-64.4% of patients treated with afatinib, with only 4.4%-8.3% of the cases being grade 3-4. Dose reduction tended to occur in patients who had higher initial afatinib plasma concentrations and led to decreases in the incidence and severity of afatinib-related AEs without affecting therapeutic efficacy. The incidence of gastrointestinal AEs could be decreased \>50% with proper afatinib dose reduction.

The effect of 1st line afatinib 30 mg daily in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC is unknown. We hypothesize that, in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, 1st line afatinib treatment at 30 mg daily is tolerable with less gastrointestinal AEs and with a similar efficacy to standard dose afatinib.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT02754973,Integrated Experiential Training Program With Coaching by Nursing Students in Childhood Cancer Patients,"Child, Neoplasms","an integrated experiential training program with coaching, Placebo Control",INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"Background: Despite the evidence that regular physical activity can have beneficial effects on the physical and psychological well-being of cancer patients, a review of the literature reveals that a majority of young cancer patients fail to attain the same levels of physical activity that they had before contracting the disease. There is scientific evidence that physical inactivity induces muscle catabolism and atrophy and cardiovascular diseases, which may lead to a further increase in fatigue and a decrease in the functional capacity of cancer patients. Empirical evidence is needed to explore an appropriate strategy for promoting physical activity in such patients.

Purposes: To examine the effectiveness of an integrated experiential training program with coaching by nursing students in promoting regular physical activity, reducing fatigue and enhancing quality of life among Hong Kong Chinese childhood cancer patients.

Design and Subjects: A randomised controlled trial (RCT), two-group pre-test and repeated post-test, within and between subjects design will be conducted. Recruitment of subjects will be carried out in a paediatric oncology ward of a Hong Kong acute care hospital.

Intervention: Participants in the experimental group will join an integrated experiential training program with coaching by nursing students, which contains 28 home visits by a designated nursing student as a coach for a 6-month period.

Non-sterilized male partners of a female subject must have used male condoms plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.

    Female subjects should have also refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period described above.

    Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or post-menopausal.

    Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:
    * Females \<50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).
    * Females ≥ 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses \>1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses \>1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).

    Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening through 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or through 6 months after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Female partners (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of contraception.

    Male subjects should have refrained from sperm donation throughout the period described above.

    A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action \[excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective\]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).
17. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have put the subject at unacceptable risk.
18. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following the last durvalumab treatment or 6 months after the last tremelimumab treatment, whichever was longer.",104

NCT04891731,Efficacy and Safety of Leuprorelin 3M in Premenopausal Women With Hormone Receptor-positive Breast Cancer,Hormone Receptor-positive Breast Cancer,AI or TAM,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Leuprorelin, a LHRH agonist, acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion and is commonly used for the treatment of hormone-responsive prostate cancer, premenopausal HR+ breast cancer, endometriosis and uterine fibroids. It is currently available in 1M, 3M, 6M for subcutaneous administration. Initially administration would stimulate an increase in LH and FSH, causing a transient increase of E2 in 2-4 weeks. Continuous administration results in a subsequent decrease in E2 levels, as a result of decreased levels of luteinizing LH and FSH. After stopping injection, ovarian function could gradually recover. Adverse events related to leuprorelin include flushing, mood swings and urogenital symptoms.

At present, the treatment of premenopausal breast cancer mainly includes 1M and 3M GnRHa. Leuprorelin 11.25mg dosage form is currently the only 3M GnRHa in China that has gotten breast cancer indications. The use of 3M GnRHa could improve patients' compliance and reduce injection discomfort. However, previous studies about GnRHa alone or in combination with TAM or AIs usually used 1M GnRHa. There have been few studies reporting the suppression effects of E2 levels and clinical outcome with leuprorelin 3M in combination with TAM or AIs.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT05630131,ctDNA in Subjects With Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer Treated With Trimodality Therapy,"Bladder Cancer, Muscle-Invasive Bladder Carcinoma",N/A,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"The purpose of this prospective biospecimen collection study is to evaluate the feasibility of measuring circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in subjects with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) treated with trimodality therapy consisting of a maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor followed by radiation and concomitant chemotherapy.

Cancer cells have unique genes that determine the characteristics of tumors, such as how they will respond to different treatments. The tumor tissue will be used to determine the genes present in cancer cells. Tumor cells sometimes release fragments of DNA into the blood or urine (circulating tumor DNA or ctDNA) and measuring levels of ctDNA may be a way to monitor cancer and predict to determine which treatment works better and what will be the outcome of cancer.

Urine, blood, and tumor tissue are called biospecimens. Biospecimens can help researchers understand how the human body works. Researchers may develop new tests to monitor diseases or new ways to treat diseases. Plasma and urine specimens will be collected before, during, and after the standard-of-care treatment.

This study will estimate the feasibility of collecting plasma ctDNA detection in subjects with MIBC. If this information can be successfully collected and processed, the usefulness of ctDNA to predict tumor response to certain kinds of treatment or disease progression will be evaluated.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT04501731,"Controlling Coordination After Childhood Cerebellar Cancer, a Pilot Study",Brain Cancer,"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Motor assessment, Questionnaires",OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Posterior fossa tumours (PFT) account for 2/3 of childhood brain cancers. They can be highly malignant requiring combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy post-surgery for a \>50% chance of cure. PFT frequently involve the cerebellum which is responsible for coordinating movement, balance, emotional control, and links closely to control of affect and executive function. PFT survivors show highly variable profiles for cognitive and sensorimotor functioning which are influenced strongly by the severity of the pre-diagnostic or post-surgical brain injury

State-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can allow to measure a variety of different biological processes in the brain, and the investigators believe that some of these MRI measures (called MRI biomarkers) have the potential to improve our ability to understand and monitor consequences of the ablative brain surgery and complex mechanisms of motor skills recovery. Biomarkers are very important for the development of intervention because 1) they help understand the recuperation process and 2) they allow to effectively assess whether or not a treatment or intervention works.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful non-invasive neuro-modulatory intervention that has the potential to evaluate the integrity of the nervous tracts from the brain to the hand. It is a procedure that applies magnetic pulses on the surface of the scalp to reach underlying brain tissue. TMS has built a reputable status among neuro-rehabilitative research, and there is currently a major effort to translate the positive research findings into clinically useful therapeutic strategies.

This study is therefore an important first step towards understanding how potential MRI biomarkers and responses to TMS relate to motor symptoms in PFT young survivors. Once completed, this study will allow the investigators to select the most promising MRI biomarkers and TMS protocols to take forward into future treatment trials. The investigators aim to stimulate the recovery of coordination skills, help the development of targeted therapies, and consequently improve long-term quality of life in children and young people with history of brain tumour.

The proposed research intends to prove the feasibility of such brain stimulation and imaging and collect some preliminary measures","Inclusion Criteria:

The cancer plans and the INCA recommend support during and after cancer treatment, taking into account both medical and psycho-social specificities related to age (support care, school learning/training and professional integration, fertility preservation, therapeutic education, addictology, sexology...). In this context, AJA teams have been developed in which the Nurse Coordinators (IDEC) play a fundamental role. These Nurse Coordinators are available to young patients, their families and the professionals who accompany follow them in their therapeutic journey. Their main missions are to assess the specific needs of these young people and their loved ones, to inform, orient and participate in the coordination of their care by providing psychosocial and paramedical solutions to these young patients. The circular of 30/05/2016 on the coordinated regional organization of care for AJAs supports the development of connected health tools for AJAs. This population is adept to new technologies, social networks allowing them to continue to be informed and remain integrated to the outside world while helping them prepare for life after cancer.

Their clinical behavior is quite variable, encompassing both benign lesions and aggressive tumors that invade surrounding and/or distant structures. NENs may also cause serious morbidity due to hormone oversecretion. NENs are among the most frequently inherited human tumors, presenting either isolated or as part of syndromes in which a single patient or family develops multiple tumors. There are also non-inherited changes in the genetic information of the tumor cells that are potential targets for treatment. Both inherited and non-inherited DNA defects can be identified using modern routine genetic tests which, unfortunately, are not widely available in Mexico.

This project seeks to uncover the genetic defects causing NENs in a large cohort of Mexican patients, using three different methods for genetic testing. Adult individuals with various types of NENs from two reference hospitals in Mexico City will be invited to participate. After completing informed consent, blood and, if possible, tissue samples will be obtained from all participants. Clinical details, laboratory results, imaging studies, and histopathological data at disease presentation will be retrieved.

An initial screening will be performed by analyzing changes in the sequence of multiple genes that have been associated with the occurrence of NENs. In cases with negative screening, a specific method to assess changes in the number of copies of the same genes will also be employed. Finally, sequences of all DNA regions encoding information required to make proteins will be obtained in selected cases. Analyses will be carried out in blood and, if available, also in tumor tissue samples from study participants. Screening of additional family members will be offered.

This project will accurately describe the repertoire of specific defects causing NENs in the study population, and will likely uncover and characterize novel genetic associations. The results will contribute for a better understanding of the alterations within and outside known driver genes that shape syndromic presentations, tumor behaviors, and inheritance patterns in individuals with NENs. These data will contribute to improve the information on the molecular bases of NENs, including alterations that can be used as therapeutic targets.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT02528682,MiHA-loaded PD-L-silenced DC Vaccination After Allogeneic SCT,Hematological Malignancies,MiHA-loaded PD-L-silenced DC Vaccination,INTERVENTIONAL,"PHASE1, PHASE2","Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a potent treatment, and sometimes the only curative treatment for aggressive hematological malignancies. The therapeutic efficacy is attributed to the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) response, during which donor-derived CD8+ T cells become activated by recipient minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) presented on dendritic cells (DC). Consequently, these alloreactive donor T cells clonally expand, acquire effector functions and kill MiHA-positive malignant cells. However, in a substantial number of patients persistence and recurrence of malignant disease is observed, indicating that insufficient GVT immunity is induced. This is reflected by our observation that not all patients develop a productive CD8+ T cell response towards MiHA mismatched between the recipient and donor. We found that the PD-1/PD-L1 co-inhibitory pathway is involved in dampening MiHA-specific CD8+ T cell expansion and function post-transplantation. Therefore, a promising strategy to induce or boost GVT immune responses is pre-emptive or therapeutic vaccination with ex vivo-generated donor DCs loaded with MiHA that are exclusively expressed by recipient hematopoietic cells and their malignant counterparts. In contrast to pre-emptive donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) with polyclonal donor T cells, this MiHA-DC vaccination approach has less risk of inducing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the potency to induce more efficient GVT-associated T cell immunity. In addition, the potency of this DC vaccine will be further enhanced by interference with the PD-1/PD-L1 co-inhibitory pathway, using siRNA mediated PD-L1/PD-L2 silencing.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT06658782,Abbreviated Magnetic Resonance Imaging vs Ultrasound Surveillance for Liver Cancer dETection in People at High Risk of Developing Liver Cancer,"Cirrhosis, Cirrhosis Due to Hepatitis B, Cirrhosis and Chronic Liver Disease, Cirrhosis Due to Hepatitis C, Cirrhosis of the Liver, Hepatocellular Carcinoma",non contrast enhanced MRI,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Aim: To use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans without contrast to help improve diagnosis of liver cancer in people who are at increased risk of developing liver cancer.

Background: People with any condition that affects the liver over a long period of time can develop cirrhosis. Conditions and risk factors that can lead to cirrhosis include alcohol excess, liver steatosis (lipid or fat accumulation in the liver) and infection with the viruses hepatitis B and C. One of the concerns about people with cirrhosis is that they are at increased risk of developing liver cancer. People with cirrhosis are recommended to have an ultrasound scan (USS) every 6 months (surveillance for liver cancer) so that if a cancer develops, it is diagnosed at an early stage when it can be cured. However, ultrasound can miss cancers even in people having scans every 6 months. Furthermore, the risk of cancer is not alike among people with cirrhosis. For example, people with more advanced cirrhosis and those with cirrhosis from hepatitis B are at higher risk. It is therefore possible that better tests than ultrasound are needed for people with cirrhosis who are at particularly high risk of developing cancer.

Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans with dye injection (contrast) are used for liver cancer diagnosis. However, they cannot be done every 6 months because of costs, capacity and toxicity from high CT radiation doses, and MRI contrast build-up in the brain with repeated MRI contrast injections. MRI scans without contrast are not toxic, could be done in 20 minutes and are cheaper, so could be done every 6 months. In the experience of the study investigators, MRI without contrast may raise suspicion of liver cancer in cases missed by ultrasound, so it could be used for surveillance instead of ultrasound. This study aims to find out if it is feasible to use a quick MRI (20 minutes) without contrast as surveillance for liver cancer in people at high risk of liver cancer due to liver cirrhosis and to compare this MRI with ultrasound.

Design and Methods: The investigators will recruit 300 people at higher risk of developing liver cancer because of cirrhosis. Study participants will have an ultrasound scan every 6 months as they would in their standard clinical care and an additional 6 monthly non-contrast MRI scan for 30 months (6 visits). If the ultrasound or non-contrast MRI raises concern for a possible liver cancer, an MRI scan with contrast (with dye injection) will be done for definitive diagnosis. All participants will have an MRI with contrast at the end of 30 months (M30) to ensure that no cancers were missed. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires to measure quality of life, anxiety, and their experience of MRI and ultrasound scans and data will be collected from their medical notes. The number of liver cancers detected by ultrasound will be compared to the number detected by the non-contrast MRI scans.","Inclusion Criteria:

The overall aim of this LIFE-SCREEN pilot study is to test the trial methods and procedures to be used in the LIFE-SCREEN cluster randomized RCT, in order to discover obstacles and problems prior to the main RCT so that corrective actions can be taken to improve the research process.

The patients (n=40) will be recruited at the Centre Léon Bérard and at the Hôpital Edouard Herriot at the time of CRC screening.

After inclusion, the intervention material (documents explaining the strategies to achieve and maintain recommended behaviours as part of a healthier lifestyle) may be given to the patient during the pre-colonoscopy consultation and/or at the post-colonoscopy visit. Weight, height and blood pressure will be measured during the pre-colonoscopy consultation. Patients will be invited to complete a baseline questionnaire to collect information on their lifestyle, state of health and socio-demographic status. Approximately four to six weeks after, patients will also be asked to complete an evaluation questionnaire asking for their opinion on this material and the procedures. Focus groups with available and willing participants and hospital staff will be organized at the end of the pilot phase recruitment, to gather additional information on the intervention procedures. In addition, all hospital staff will be asked to complete an assessment questionnaire.

Biological samples will then also be collected to test the objective baseline measure of nutritional changes used in the RCT. In order to assess the feasibility and the acceptability of urine, faecal and blood sample collection in this population, the first ten participants recruited (n=10) will be given the option to refuse one or more of the biological sample collections (phase I). Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire to provide information on their opinion and willingness to donate biological samples.

Bladder cancer is one of the major health concerns of the world. The present methods of diagnosis are: Ultra sound, Cystoscopy, CT scan and urine cytology. All these are stressful to the patients, particularly Cystoscopy which is commonly employed for the follow up of Bladder cancer patients.

Research Significance:

The present study will employ a new photodynamic diagnostic procedure to quantify a certain cancer specific biomarker called Porphyrin, which selectively binds on to the bladder cancer tissues. In this context the present technique offer viable, very easy and reliable table top instrumentation for diagnosis and continual monitoring of disease regression through urine.

Research Objectives:

* To quantify bladder cancer specific biomarkers such as Porphyrin using photodynamic diagnostic procedure
* To find out whether this technique might be a new and easy tool for bladder cancer diagnosis only by urine.

Research Methodology:

The bladder cancer patients is required to swallow a chemical called ALA (5 Amino levulinic Acid hydrochloride), about 10mg/kg body weight which will play a role of biological indicator. ALA gets metabolized into certain types of porphyrins which selectively bind on to the tumor tissues (for a longer time than the normal tissues). 5ml of blood and one urine samples will be taken before using ALA. The patient must drink water then the urine will be collected after 4, 8 and 12 hours of taking ALA and the samples will be analyzed by photodynamic diagnostic procedure.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT03776331,Vascular Functions in Myeloma Patients During Anti-tumor Therapy,"Cardiooncology, Myeloma, Endothelial Dysfunction",Flow mediated dilation,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Treatment options for multiple myeloma have increased significantly over the last years with the approval of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs). These therapies have markedly improved overall survival for these patients to a median of 5-7 years. Due to the advanced age, the myeloma patient collective has a high prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities. In addition, the primary disease process contributes to cardiovascular complications. With the beginning of anti-tumor therapy, an increased incidence of cardiovascular complications in myeloma patients can be determined. This includes hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and both arterial and venous thromboembolic events. The detailed mechanism by which proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents lead to increased cardiovascular events is not established at this time. Endothelial dysfunction, as a possible mechanism of cardiovascular toxicity, is difficult to assess. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is an noninvasive method to measure endothelial function by assessing the change in the vasodilatative reserve of the brachial artery. Several independent recent investigations implicate that vascular (endothelial) dysfunction precedes hypertension and heart failure. This has been related to a reduced level of metabolites of the l-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway.

Hypothesis:

1. Anti-myeloma therapy exert vascular toxicity by limiting endothelial function. Endothelial function, assessed by the change in the vasodilatative reserve of the brachial artery (flow-mediated dilation = FMD) decreases after myeloma therapy.
2. Patients with multiple myeloma have a limited endothelial function compared to a healthy control group.

A total of 40 myeloma patients will be examined. Measurements will be taken at baseline, 1 month and 6 month after myeloma therapy. Patients should not have received chemotherapy for at least 3 months.

NCT01019382,A Study of the Effect of Gemcitabine With Fish Oil in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer,Pancreatic Neoplasms,Lipidem fish oil infusion + Gemcitabine chemotherapy,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"Over 7000 patients are diagnosed with pancreas cancer every year in the UK. Only 10% have it caught early enough to have surgery to cure it. The rest at best can undergo chemotherapy to extend survival, but current treatments offer at best an improvement of only a few months compared to no treatment at all. In addition only about a quarter of patients will respond to the treatment. In addition these patients often experience profound weight loss, loss of appetite and energy primarily because of the cancer process itself. Our hypothesis is that the addition of fish oil infusion to gemcitabine chemotherapy will result in an improved rate of tumour response on CT imaging.

Fish oils, or specifically the omega-3 fatty acid component, appear to have a range of powerful anti-cancer actions. This is supported by evidence from a wide range of sources, from laboratory experiments to basic human studies. Although this evidence specifically includes many pancreatic cancer studies in the laboratory it has not yet been confirmed in human trials.

Contrary to conventional chemotherapy, fish oil is a naturally occuring non-toxic compound and so is not associated with the side-effects of chemotherapy. In fact a number of clinical studies have demonstrated significant improvements in quality of life for pancreas cancer patients treated with fish oil, particularly with reference to improvements in appetite and energy levels. This is of course in addition to the anti-cancer actions.","Inclusion Criteria:

In each patient, 13C NMR spectral analysis of tumor extracts will be obtained after intraoperative infusion of \[U-13C\]glucose or \[1,2-13C\]glucose. Whenever feasible, patients will undergo 3 preoperative imaging studies - 18FDG-PET, diffusion tensor imaging with 1H-spectroscopy on 3T MR scanner, and ultra high resolution MR imaging on the 7T MR scanner. The results of these imaging studies will be correlated with the metabolic phenotype to generate a comprehensive non-invasive view of the tumor with the goal of identifying infiltrative, metabolically active tumor cells within the brain. In addition, a comprehensive molecular profile of the tumor will be obtained and enable a genotype-metabolic phenotype comparative analysis.

Correlative Translational Research The investigators will obtain tumor tissue from each patient for comprehensive molecular analysis (array CGH, expression profiling, methylation profiling) which will be correlated with tumor histology, the metabolites identified by 1H-MR spectroscopy and the 13Cglucose metabolic profile.

NCT03689231,Volumetric Imaging Follow up of Patients With Liver Metastases of Small Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs).,"Neuroendocrine Tumors, Liver Metastases",Volumetric measurements of liver metastases,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"More than 50% of intestinal NETs are metastatic at the time of diagnosis, the liver being the main affected organ in 50-90% of cases.

Initial liver tumor burden and slope of the tumor growth rate are two major prognostic factors in patients with intestinal NETs, followed by tumor grade at pathology. They are used in routine practice by oncologists to adapt patient treatment.

Unlike other tumors, most NETs metastases are slow-growing tumors. Previous studies have shown that approximately half of the patients diagnosed with liver metastases showed no progression over a period of 3 to 6 months.

The aim of this non randomised retrospective cohort study is to investigate whether the volumetric monitoring of the total tumor burden compared to the RECIST 1.1 criteria (used in routine practice by radiologists) at baseline and early follow-up (3 to 6 months) is more suitable for NETs, making possible to predict the prognosis at the onset of the disease, and also allowing a better adaptation of the treatment.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate if the initial volume of the liver tumor is a prognostic factor of time to progression, to correlate the initial liver tumor volume and the number of liver lesions to the blood concentration of Chromogranin A (CgA), the presence of extra-abdominal disease and to correlate the tumor growth rate (TGR) and KI 67 (%) at base-line.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT04575831,"Exercise, Nutrition, and Palliative Care in Advanced Lung Cancer (ENPAL)",Advanced Lung Cancer,"Exercise, Nutrition, and Palliative Symptom Management",INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"Background: Evidence supports exercise and nutrition as beneficial for enhancing QOL in earlier stages of lung cancer; however, there is minimal research of either intervention - and none with combined interventions - in advanced lung cancer patients. In addition to a multimodal intervention approach that includes nutrition and exercise, consideration of advanced cancer care symptom management is crucial for optimizing the potential benefits of either intervention.

Objectives: Primary outcome measure of this study is feasibility, including recruitment (% who participate from those eligible), attendance (weekly group class), assessment completion, safety (adverse event reporting), attrition rates, and qualitative themes generated from one-on-one participant interviews. The secondary outcome to be measured is the impact of the intervention on PROs, including QOL, fatigue and symptom burden, as well as self-reported physical activity levels and physical function assessed in-person.

Methods: The proposed exercise intervention will include a centre-based group exercise program plus home-based exercises, and behaviour change support for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, classified as stage III or IV with self-reported symptom burden. Eligible participants must be cleared by the health care professionals (HCP) to engage in mild to moderate levels of physical activity (PA). Using a prospective, mixed-methods design (supported by the Medical Research Council guidance for the evaluation of complex interventions), the quantitative component of this pilot study will measure feasibility and exploratory outcome measures, with an embedded qualitative component to examine participant perspectives about study tolerability/feasibility of the intervention. A subset of participants and instructors will be recruited for qualitative interviews using purposive sampling to achieve maximum variation based on factors that may lead to different viewpoints (e.g., age, gender, lung cancer type/stage, treatment).

Relevance: The proposed work will inform the design of a future pragmatic trial for this population. The goal is to build a patient-focused model of care that delivers wellness resources for advanced lung cancer care that will ultimately improve the patients' health and QOL. This approach is novel, patient-focused, and will build a tailored approach within existing resources to deliver optimal care.","Inclusion Criteria:

Cetuximab targets a receptor on cancer cells called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor or EGFR. It is thought that this receptor is turned ""on"" in some cancers, enabling cancer cells to divide and grow. Blocking this receptor can turn this signal off. Cetuximab blocks this receptor from the outside of cancer cells. It is thought that cancer cells can turn this signal back on by the EGFR joining with a related receptor called ErbB2. Lapatinib blocks both EGFR and ErbB2 from the inside of cancer cells. In laboratory experiments it has been found that combining drugs that target both EGFR and ErbB2 might work better in turning this signal back off. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dosages that patients can tolerate when these two medicines are given at the same time.

In addition, in order to be on this trial, patients must agree to have a tumor biopsy before starting treatment on this study and 21 days after starting treatment.

NCT06235931,A Clinical Study of Darcilil Combined With AI Combined With Pyrrotinib in the Treatment of TPBC,Breast Neoplasms,Darcilide +AI (letrozole/anastrozole/Exemestane) + pyrrotinib,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"Elderly patients with advanced triple-positive breast cancer have the characteristics of low physical status and poor treatment tolerance. Therefore, such patients are often unable to tolerate more toxic chemotherapy regimen, and it is particularly important to choose a highly effective and low-toxic treatment regimen. However, few studies have paid attention to the treatment of such patients in the past.

Pyrrotinib is a small molecule, irreversible, panerbb receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which was independently developed by our country and has shown excellent efficacy in second-line anti-HER2 treatment of breast cancer, and has become the second-line standard treatment choice for advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. In addition, PHILA study results showed that the mPFS of pyrrotinib group reached 24 months. Compared with the control group, the duration of 10 months was significantly extended, indicating the significant efficacy of pyrrotinib in the first-line treatment of advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.

Darsili is a CDK4/6 inhibitor independently developed in China, which has been reconstructed and optimized in molecular structure, and has become a new CDK4/6 inhibitor with more powerful modification by introducing piperidine structure through replacement of classical electronic and other panbody. The results of DAWNA-2 study indicated that the mPFS of Dalsily combined AI group reached 30.6 months, which was significantly longer than 18.2 months of the control group, and was the longest in similar studies.

MUKDEN01 study, for the first time, tried the efficacy of pyrrotinib + letrozole + Dalsily regimen in the new adjuvant therapy of TPBC patients, and the results showed that ORR reached 87.4%, CR rate was 30.4%, and pCR rate was 35.4%. Therefore, to further confirm the efficacy and safety of this protocol in elderly patients with advanced triple positive breast cancer, we intend to conduct this study. This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center clinical trial in which participants were treated with darcilide +AI (letrozole/anastrozole/exemestane) + pyrrotinib until disease progression, toxicity became intolerable, informed consent was withdrawn, or investigator judgment required discontinuation. The successful development of this study provides a new direction for the first-line treatment of elderly advanced triple-positive breast cancer.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT05770531,Circulating Tumor DNA to Guide Changes in Standard of Care Chemotherapy,"Metastatic HER2-Negative Breast Carcinoma, Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma","Biospecimen Collection, Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Biospecimen Collection, Sacituzumab Govitecan",INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"This phase II trial tests how well evaluating circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) works to guide therapy-change decisions in treating patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). This study wants to learn if small pieces of DNA associated with a tumor (called circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA) can be detected in investigational blood tests during the course of standard chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, and whether information from such investigational ctDNA blood testing could possibly be used as an early indication of chemotherapy treatment failure. It is hoped that additional information from investigational blood testing for ctDNA could help doctors to switch more quickly from a standard chemotherapy treatment that typically has significant side effects and which may not be working, to a different standard treatment regimen against TNBC, called sacituzumab govitecan. Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called hRS7, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called irinotecan. hRS7 is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as TROP2 receptors, and delivers irinotecan to kill them. Studying ctDNA may assist doctors to change therapy earlier if needed, and may improve health outcomes in patients with metastatic TNBC.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT02381782,Validation of uHear™ as a Screening Tool to Detect Hearing Impairment in Elderly Cancer Patients Within a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment,"Hearing Loss, Cancer",N/A,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Over the last few years, there has been a considerable interest in the development of screening tools to assess the capability of elderly cancer patients to tolerate anti-cancer treatment. Therefore, the NCCN Guidelines in Senior Adult Oncology recommend an assessment of co-morbid conditions that are likely to interfere with cancer treatment and tolerability. As presbyacusis is common in an older population, elderly cancer patients are at high risk for social isolation and a reduced quality of life.

The goal is to compare the effects of two home physical exercise protocols on quality of life and physical fitness of elderly people with breast cancer who are in hormone use. A study was carried out at the Institute of Integral Medicine Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP) within the Professional Master Program in Palliative Care Associated with the Residency Program in Health, which evaluated the effectiveness of a protocol of 29 exercises with walking sessions, performed at home , In the quality of life and physical fitness of the elderly in the treatment of breast cancer. The results of the mentioned research showed that the elderly showed improvement both in quality of life and physical fitness.

In view of the results and the clinical and functional kinetic observation of these patients, the hypothesis was that a shorter intervention protocol, with fewer exercises with fewer repetitions and a lower degree of difficulty can bring results similar to those found, requiring a shorter time In the accomplishment of the exercises, which can favor the adherence to the protocol by the patients, still achieving positive results in their quality of life and physical fitness.

NCT02251782,Adherence to Minimally Invasive Testing,Colorectal Cancer,"Epi proColon Test, Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT)",OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has been demonstrated to reduce long term disease burden and costs. Unfortunately, less than 65 % of age-eligible persons in the US are actually screened for CRC. The leading methods, colonoscopy and FIT (fecal immunochemical test) testing, both have patient-associated barriers that reduce their use. The combination of bowel preparation and procedure time are barriers to colonoscopy, while stool handling as part of the sampling protocol reduces FIT usage.

It has been hypothesized and supported by a variety of preference studies that the availability of a blood-based assay for CRC screening would increase patient participation and adherence to CRC screening by reducing barriers that prevent participation.

This study is designed to investigate the relative participation in CRC screening in average risk, screening eligible patients with demonstrated non-adherence to guideline-recommended screening modalities. Participation with the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and the blood-based Epi proColon® test will be examined. Screening eligible average-risk patients identified as non-adherent by medical record will be eligible for the study. Potential subjects will be recruited to participate in a study via mailing and/or at a clinic visit. All study subjects will be enrolled at a clinic visit and will be randomized in two study arms. Those assigned to Arm 1 will be offered a FIT test kit for home use. Those assigned to Arm 2 will be offered a blood draw for the Epi proColon test. Rates of adherence will be compared between those that accept and complete the blood test and those that accept and complete the FIT test. A passive control, usual care arm will comprise subjects meeting eligibility criteria, but not recruited for or participating in the study.

In conjunction with published data (Johnson et al, 2014), the relative utilization of the blood test will be compared to the screening participation via FIT. Increased participation with the Epi proColon blood test could increase screening rates in the non-adherent population. Additionally, for those testing positive in the trial, the rate of adherence to colonoscopy will be determined.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT01255631,Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF) and Post-Axillary Surgery Morbidity,Shoulder Symptoms After Lymph Node Dissection,"PEMF Device, Sham PEMF Device",INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,"The most important prognostic indicator for the breast cancer patient is the axillary lymph node status. With the introduction of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, many women were spared the morbidity of a full axillary lymph node dissection(ALND) while having the axillary nodes assessed with a low false negative rate. Approximately 30% of women who undergo ALND experience shoulder/arm morbidity including numbness, pain, weakness and decreased range of motion. In addition, the sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) held the promise that women with early stage breast cancer would be able to avoid the dreaded morbidity associated with axillary lymph node dissections including lymphedema, decreased range of motion and pain. Since the adoption of SLN, numerous papers have documented that SLN is superior to ALND. However, patients who undergo SLN still have a significant amount of pain with this procedure. There are few published studies which objectively assess the subjective and objective symptoms of SLND.

Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of fractures and spinal fusion, relief of pain in acute sprains and whiplash injuries, improvement of skin blood flow, healing of venous stasis ulcers, and reduction of postmastectomy lymphedema. Indeed, radiofrequency PEMF devices are FDA approved for pain and edema relief. PEMF devices are economical and disposable, and can be incorporated unobtrusively in standard post-op dressings. We have recently reported, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study on breast reduction, that post-op PEMF therapy produced a significant decrease in pain and pain medication use, along with a concomitant decrease in IL1-beta in the wound bed.1 The current pilot study will be designed to determine if PEMF treatment, given in addition to standard of care, can reduce post-operative discomfort and morbidity after lumpectomy and SLND, or lumpectomy and ALND. Lumpectomy and ALND/SLND patients enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled study will undergo standard surgery, but will be randomized to one of two groups: the treatment group with a PEMF coil placed around the arm and the control group with a coil that delivers no PMF. We expect postoperative pain to be reduced in the PEMF-treated patients as well as improved arm mobility and strength. The use of PEMF might reduce the need for narcotic pain medications and their side effects of sedation, nausea, and vomiting. It may also reduce costs related to arm morbidity.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Inclusion criteria include patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node dissection for breast cancer. Patients undergoing lumpectomy with the axillary surgery will be included.

* Patients undergoing mastectomy with the axillary surgery will be excluded.

The most common method to prevent urinary retention after radical hysterectomy is continuous catheterization, but up to 14.5% of patients need continuous catheterization for more than 4 weeks, because catheterization is an invasive procedure, increasing the risk of urinary tract infection, and long-term postoperative retention of urinary catheter caused by edema of the vesicourethral sphincter and urethral glands. Obstruction of bladder outlet caused by increased urethral outflow resistance may also lead to postoperative urinary retention, thus forming a vicious cycle and aggravating urinary retention.

In our previous retrospective analysis, it was confirmed that acupuncture and moxibustion were effective in restoring bladder function after radical hysterectomy. Compared with the control group, the incidence of urinary retention in patients receiving acupuncture and moxibustion was reduced from 44.17% to 24.17%, and no serious adverse reactions occurred, and the patients had good tolerance.

Phase II clinical trials test how well an investigational drug works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. MLN0128 is not approved by the FDA.

The purpose of this study is to see what effects (good and bad) the study drug MLN0128 has on the patient and the cancer. MLN0128 is a drug that belongs to a class of drugs called ""mTOR kinase inhibitors"". A protein, called ""mTOR"" inside the cells in the body, plays a role in controlling how cells grow. In some cancer cells, mTOR may be over-active. This over-activity may cause some cancer cells to grow out of control. Research has shown that mTOR inhibitors can block this overactivity and may help stop or slow down the growth of some types of cancer cells.","To be included in this study, patients should have histologically confirmed castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer with evidence of disease progression.

Background:

Currently, patients with intermediate or high risk prostate cancer are staged with CT abdomen and pelvis and bone scan to assess for distant metastases. Patients with biochemical recurrence after primary therapy are restaged in a similar manner. Locally, multiparametric MR of the prostate or prostate bed may also be obtained in select cases.

Patients recruited for this registry will be staged/ restaged with PSMA PET (PET/CT or PET/MR) to determine whether this imaging strategy results in more accurate detection of metastatic disease (for patients undergoing primary staging) or detection of local recurrence or distant disease (for patients undergoing restaging). Choice of imaging method (PET/CT or PET/MR) will be made by one of the study PIs, based on clinical judgement taking into account the specific exam indication, prior recent imaging, and suitability for MR imaging.

Study design:

This is a single arm study to assess the contribution of PSMA PET imaging (PET/MR or PET/CT) to the management of patients with prostate cancer (PCa).

In this prospective trial, the investigators will recruit 200 men whom will undergo PET imaging using an integrated PET/CT scanner or with an integrated PET/MR.

NCT05326282,Evaluating the Role of Ultrasound in Prostate Cancer,Prostate Cancer,Multi-parametric ultrasound,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"Active surveillance (AS) is becoming an increasingly common treatment option for men who have been diagnosed with localised low-grade prostate cancer (PCa). Low-grade disease is commonly noted by clinicians to be clinically insignificant cancer but remains a psychological burden to many men in this cohort. There is consensus that regular review is required for men on AS so that early treatment can be undertaken if there is disease progression, and to support men living with a cancer diagnosis. Some AS protocols, including National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), advocate the use of MRI as a regular part of the monitoring pathway.

Unfortunately, access to MRI for AS, within the current health care environment in the UK, is limited due to increasing demand for primary diagnostic examinations, particularly in the post pandemic recovery phase. Emerging technologies in ultrasound imaging may, however, add another diagnostic tool to monitor disease for patients on AS. This proof of concept study is to evaluate whether new multi-parametric ultrasound techniques can safely reduce the number of MRIs required for effective AS.

Men being investigated for PCa will be invited to undergo an ultrasound examination of their prostate, via the rectum, in addition to the diagnostic MRI undertaken as part of normal care. The findings of the ultrasound will be directly compared with the MRI and any subsequent biopsy samples taken as part of routine care. Those who then progress onto AS will be invited to undergo regular rectal prostate ultrasound examinations. These will be compared with previous imaging for signs of change.

This study will also evaluate the changing role of practitioners who will be using new technologies and making decisions about disease progression. The ability to implement new techniques will be assessed. All imaging will be undertaken at Castle Hill Hospital over a 24-month period from commencement of the study.","Inclusion Criteria:

In a small pilot study, scientists at the Medical University of Vienna demonstrated that measurement of a combination of mRNA markers extracted from CTCs captured using the Parsortix system could be used to identify women with ovarian cancer. This study is designed to provide specimens for optimization of an assay using clinical and biomarker information (i.e. demographics, imaging results and/or serum tumor markers) in combination with mRNA extracted from rare cells in the blood of women presenting with a pelvic mass for the detection of malignancy.

Primary Objective: Optimization of an assay for the differentiation of women with benign pelvic masses from those with malignant pelvic masses using mRNA markers extracted from CTCs isolated from whole blood. Multiple serum tumor markers and mRNA markers will be measured, and the results will be compared to the actual clinical diagnosis made for each patient through other recognized methods (e.g. histopathology). The blood samples collected in the course of this study will be used to finalize the selection of mRNA and/or serum tumor markers to be evaluated in future prospective studies.

This procedure is the preferred surgical procedure for treating tumors around the ampulla. Traditional open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) has brought great surgical trauma to patients while treating diseases. In 1994, Gagner et al first reported laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD). With the development of laparoscopic techniques, the updating of devices, and the continuous accumulation of laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery experience, the results of retrospective studies published show that there is no significant difference in safety between LPD and OPD. However, the results of the recently published RCT study show that the mortality associated with LPD complications is five times greater than that of OPD. At present, the security of LPD has been controversial. Therefore we conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial with a primary outcome of perioperative complications, providing evidence-based results for the safe and effective clinical development of LPD.","Preoperative imaging diagnosis of periampullary tumor, or preoperative pathological diagnosis of periampullary tumor, preoperative evaluation can be performed pancreaticoduodenectomy; Serum bilirubin was less than 100 μ mol/L before operation; Sign a written informed consent form and agree to be randomly divided into groups for surgical treatment.",102

NCT00470782,Aerobic Capacity and Body Composition in Colon Cancer Patients,Colonic Neoplasms,N/A,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Recent studies have shown that survival after a colorectal cancer diagnosis may be affected by a person's activity level and body size. This research says that for colorectal cancer patients, the less active and more obese they are, the more likely they are to have a cancer recurrence or die from their cancer. Chemotherapy has been shown to reduce activity levels, fitness, and body size in some cancer patients. However, it is not known how chemotherapy specific for colon cancer patients affects their activity levels, fitness, and body size. The main goal of our study will be to look at how chemotherapy treatments affect the fitness, activity levels, and body size in colon cancer patients. In order to do this, we will measure these variables before chemotherapy treatments, and at 1 and 6 months following the end of treatment. Our results will show how chemotherapy affects fitness, activity levels, and body size in colon cancer patients and provide data to help in designing an exercise intervention specifically for colon cancer survivors.","Inclusion Criteria:

The results of the test are used by the doctor to recommend therapy (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) that the patient will receive before having surgery to remove the adenocarcinoma. When the patient goes to surgery, the adenocarcinoma that is removed is tested again. The results of that test are used to guide the choice of therapy after surgery.

The chemotherapy drugs and the radiation therapy used in this clinical trial are already approved for treatment of pancreas cancer. This trial is intended to establish which treatment is best for a specific patient, based on test results from that patient's actual adenocarcinoma. In the past, the decision as to which treatment the patient will receive was not based on testing of the actual adenocarcinoma.

NCT04122131,Fibrotic Focus in Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer,Immunohistochemistry,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Despite the ongoing refinement of current breast cancer staging, clinical outcome is still varied among patients of similar stage. Further exploration of novel prognostic factors is of great clinical value. In our earlier findings, we have demonstrated the added value of fibrotic focus (FF) in the current staging. However the precise composition in different components within FF and underlying mechanism involved remain to be determined. In fact, there is unappreciated heterogeneity in FF. All these have limited its application in clinical practice. In this proposal, a systemic evaluation on the FF features in breast cancers will be performed. We aim to further characterize FF at morphological, cellular and molecular levels as well as its collagen characteristics. Given the multiple lines of evidence showing its relationship with immune components, additional attention will be put on its interaction with immune tumor environment. Finally, we plan to develop prognostic model integrating these different FF features for a more accurate risk stratification. Accumulated evidence suggested that the significance of FF in breast cancer prognosis. Moreover, the impact of fibrotic stroma on tumor immune environment may be implicative in immunotherapy. The more complete understanding of FF is pre-requisite for its development as an applicable prognostic marker in breast cancer.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT03963531,Patterns of Care and Outcomes in Patients With Metastatic Bone Tumors (METABONE),Metastatic Bone Tumor,"chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, interventional radiology.",OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Bone tumors make up about 3-5% of childhood cancers and less than 1% of cancers in adults. Of these, osteosarcoma (OSS) is the most commonly diagnosed primary malignant bone tumor. OSS is a primary mesenchymal malignant tumor of bone characterized by the production of osteoid or immature bone by the malignant cells. Despite its rarity, OSS is the most common primary malignancy of bone in children and adolescents, and the fifth most common malignancy among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 19 years.

Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most frequent bone tumors in children and may arise also in soft tissues. This disease encompasses tumors formerly known as Askin's tumor, Peripheral Neuroectodermal Tumor (PNET) and the Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT).

Chondrosarcoma are rare sarcoma reputed chemorefractory in the non-operable setting and for which little is known in terms of palliative management with systemic treatments.

Despite adequate loco-regional treatment, up to 40% of patients with sarcoma, soft tissue or bone, will develop metastatic disease. When metastases are detected, the standard of care is based on palliative chemotherapy with a median survival in this setting of only 18 months.

A slight improvement has been obtained over years thank to registration of a couple of drugs such as Trabectedin and Pazopanib, the first antiangiogenic registered for soft tissue sarcoma patients. Pazopanib is routinely prescribed worldwide after failure of first line chemotherapy in soft tissue sarcoma. However, bone tumors have not benefited from these small advances yet and treatment still rely on chemotherapy combining doxorubicine cisplatinum and ifosfamide. There is no standard in relapse and palliative settings, and after failure of these agents the survival is very poor. Bone sarcomas are therefore tumors with very little available data and low level of evidence on palliative systemic treatments in clinical trials and in the real life setting.

The primary objective of the METABONE study is to conduct a retrospective descriptive analysis of clinic-biological profiles, patterns of care and modalities of treatment for a set of patients with malignant bone tumors in a real-life national setting.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT03823482,Lidocaine and Perioperative Cytokine Levels in Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid in Cerebral Aneurysm Patients,"Aneurysm, Cerebral",Lidocaine,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"Cerebral aneurysm surgery has significant mortality and morbidity rate. Inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms, their rupture, subarachnoid haemorrhage and neurologic complications. Brain injury activates immune cells and triggers cytokine release. Cytokine level in blood and cerebrospinal fluid is an indicator of inflammatory response. Cytokines contribute to secondary brain injury and can worsen the outcome of the treatment. Preventing secondary brain injury by modulating inflammatory response represents a therapeutic target. Lidocaine is local anesthetic that can be used in neurosurgery for regional anesthesia of the scalp and for topical anesthesia of the throat prior to direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. Except analgetic, lidocaine has systemic anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect. It acts through several mechanisms on various types of immune cells producing immunosuppressing effect. Lidocaine can act on activated microglia within central nervous system causing attenuation of immune response.

Primary aim of this prospective randomized trial is to determine influence of lidocaine administration on inflammatory cytokine levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during and following cerebral aneurysm surgery. Secondary aim is to determine possible correlation between levels of cytokines and incidence of neurologic and infectious postoperative complications. For that purpose, postoperative neurological clinical status will be recorded. Signs of vasospasm and pathological postoperative brain CT scan findings will be recorded. Incidence of meningitis, pneumonia and sepsis in postoperative period will also be analyzed.

Hypothesis of this trial is that lidocaine administration during cerebral aneurysm surgery would significantly change levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Lower concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines can possibly contribute to better outcome and significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications. Enzyme-immunochemical analysis will be used to measure levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Investigation group will have, during cerebrovascular surgery under general anesthesia, regional anesthesia of the scalp and topical anesthesia of the throat prior to laryngoscopy, all done with lidocaine. Control group will have general anesthesia without lidocaine administration.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT02929082,Interest of elastoFRM With Force Measure by MRI on Patients With Hepatocellular Cancer,Hepatocellular Cancer,IRM with a 5-minute- additional sequence to measure FRM,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"FORCE project aims to measure actives forces of malignant tumor by magnetic resonance force (FRM). Two main forces are considered as key indicators of therapeutic response and metastatic potential: interstitial force and traction force at the interface cell/tumor. Biomarkers of these forces will be developped using direct images of magnetic resonance force (FRM). Efficiency of these non-invasive biomarkers will be evaluated through their capacity to predict tumoral environment invasion, notably micro-vascular invasion, and therapeutical results in Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC).

Principal criteria will be

1. micro-vascular invasion assessed by pathological examination of surgical pieces (gold standard).
2. interstitial force and traction force at the cell/tumor interface assessed by FRM.

Population of patients will be divided in three groups. A first group will be constituted of 20 volunteer patients coming for abdominal MRI with no known hepatic disease, in order to determine the feasibility of FRM. A second group will be constituted of 60 patients with resectable HCC eligible for surgery. This group will enable to evaluate the tumoral environment invasion. Third group will be constituted of 50 patients with HCC eligible for transplant with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment as pending treatment before transplant. This groups will enable to evaluate the efficiency of TACE through the necrosis percentage in treated HCC.

Inclusion of patients will occur during 24 months for a total study duration of 36 months.

All patients will have MRI as usual care. FRM is performed during MRI with the use of a specific medical device and therefore corresponds to an additional procedure of the research.

NCT03048760,Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for the Delineation of Organs At Risk (OAR) and Target Volumes in Lung Cancer Patients,Lung Cancer,MRI scan,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"The Christie NHS Foundation Trust is one of seven sites worldwide within the Atlantic consortium that is developing the Elekta MR-Linac (MRL) prior to commercial release at the end of 2017. The MRL allows MR images of patients to be acquired before, during and following radiotherapy (RT). One area where The Christie is taking the lead within the consortium is the application of the MRL for lung imaging and treatment, an area where MRI has hardly been used.

MRI scans provide greater soft tissue contrast than CT scans which can aid in the accurate delineation of organs at risk (OAR) and tumour target volumes for MRL and routine treatment. In addition, MRI can provide real time imaging which can aid in the accurate motion characterisation of these volumes. The addition of functional diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has also proven to be useful in the discrimination of malignant from benign lesions; for lymph node detection and for the differentiation of tumour from atelectasis.

Auto-contouring has the potential to speed workflows at various points in the clinical pathway. This may be inter-patient contour propagation used pre-treatment for plan creation, or may be during online or offline adaptive workflows propagating contours through imaging acquired as treatment progresses. In collaboration with industry the investigators will be testing such algorithms on these images retrospectively.

In addition, the investigators would also like to evaluate patients' experiences of CT and MRI scans and determine which scanning method is preferred. Other studies have explored patient experiences of MRI compared to CT but not in the lung cancer patient population.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT02930876,Feasibility of Home vs. Hospital Based Resistance Training for Advanced Cancer Patients,Advanced Cancer,Resistance training,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"Cancer causes 8.2 million deaths each year, with an estimated worldwide cost of $895 billion. Pharmacological treatments provide improvements in expected survival and symptoms, but at cost of a high rate of toxicities and increased time spent by patients away from their homes and families during treatment. This is particularly important for patients with advanced disease as the timeframe at stake relates to their last months of life.

Sarcopenia (i.e. loss of muscle mass together with decreased functional capacity) has been widely reported as an important prognostic factor in advanced cancer, with impact on survival, toxicities, response to treatment and other patient-centered outcomes (such as functional capacity, quality of life and fatigue).

Sarcopenia is a term first used in 1988 by Rosenberg, meaning an age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass and function. It was derived from the greek: sarx = flesh and penia = loss. In 2010, a European Consensus defined sarcopenia as a triad of muscle mass loss, decreased functional performance and muscle strength. It has been reported as a hallmark of cancer, with impact on prognosis, response to treatments, side effects of chemotherapy and recovery after surgery. The prevalence of sarcopenia in advanced cancer seems to vary according to gender, stage, primary tumor location and treatments, being present in about 28 to 67% of patients.

Exercise, in particular resistance training, is one of the most powerful ways of increasing muscle mass and evidence from elderly patients suggests that it is among the most promising interventions for sarcopenia. There is evidence that resistance training can be effective but evidence is still scarce for patients with advanced disease. Historically there have been some concerns regarding safety and efficacy for oncologic patients, and though evidence suggests that resistance training is one of the most preferred forms of exercise by patients, the effectiveness of resistance training alone on sarcopenia in patients with advanced cancer remains unknown. Another question is whether home (which seems to be the patients' preferred location for exercise) produces better results than hospital (the traditional location).","Inclusion Criteria:

* chemotherapy within 90 days prior to study enrollment
* not having a baseline (pre-treatment) Computed Tomography of the Thorax Abdomen and Pelvis (CTTAP) and whole body dual x-ray absorptometry (DXA) (this is important because having an assessment of baseline muscle mass will allow us to control for baseline sarcopenia and calculate changes from baseline to post-intervention)

Methods: The study will be comprised of two phases (Phase I and II). Phase I will serve to validate at the multicenter level the results of the first, recently published, monocenter German study in terms of capacity of CEM to identify the colonic neoplastic lesions in vivo. Phase II is destined to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield of CEM in detection and prediction of neoplastic lesions by developing and adding new features to the confocal pattern of in vivo diagnosis. Two cohorts of patients will be studied in parallel: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), like ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), including those before planned colectomy, and patients with FAP after colectomy. During lower endoscopy performed under general anaesthesia, each colonic segment will be examined before and after staining with indigo-carmin. After intra-venous fluorescein injection, all macroscopically abnormal lesions will be examined by CEM, then biopsied. In parallel, multiple random biopsies will be performed, each coupled with simultaneous CEM ""optical biopsy"" at the same point. In addition, during Phase II, in IBD patients before planned colectomy and in patients with FAP, a ""mapping"" of colonic mucosa, by obtaining a very high number of CEM ""optical biopsies"", will be performed, and will be correlated with standard histology performed either on colectomy specimens (IBD) or on standard biopsies (FAP). Principal analysis (Phase I and II) will include evaluation of inter-observer variation in terms of interpretation of in vivo histology and diagnostic yield of CEM with respect to the detection of neoplastic lesions by evaluation of sensitivity and specificity, using standard histology as reference method. Additional analysis (Phase II) will be performed to evaluate the diagnostic and predictive (CRC risk) value of ""colonic mapping"" by correlating optical images pattern score to results of standard histology. Expected results: This study should guarantee high quality data, standardization of procedures and of interpretation of CEM images, which are prerequisite for dissemination of CEM in clinical practice. The investigators expect to show that CME allows to reliably discriminate between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions, that, compared to standard histology, provides better characterization of lesions, especially in the context of extended lesions like in IBD, an finally, that CME images can be used to develop a new ""optical biopsy""-based score allowing prediction of high CRC risk in patients with FAP and IBD. The investigators believe that CEM may increase, as compared to currently used techniques, the diagnostic yield in terms of probability of the detection of neoplastic lesions in patients at high risk of CCR, and may become a new standard for endoscopic surveillance in these patients.","Inclusion criteria:

We hypothesize that the inhibition of Src pathway with dasatinib will demonstrate anti-tumor activity in early stage NSCLC, with a tolerable safety profile.

Patients will receive dasatinib, a Src inhibitor, for 3 weeks prior to surgical resection for early stage NSCLC. Fresh frozen tumor tissue is needed for genomic analysis. If fresh frozen tumor tissue is not available from the initial diagnosis, a biopsy will be required to participate in this trial. A second tumor sample will be obtained at time of surgical resection to evaluate for changes in genomic expression profiles.

NCT04173676,Sentinel Lymph Node Navigation Surgery Using Near-infrared Imaging in Early Esophageal Cancer,Detection Rate of SLN ; Accuracy Rate of Lymph Node Metastasis,Indocyanine Green for Injection,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,"The esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has high prevalence and mortality in China, which become a severe challenge for public health. Esophagectomy is the preferred choice for the patients who are diagnosed with ESCC in early stage .Although three-field lymphadenectomy has improved patient survival and reduced tumor recurrence, Surgery-related complications increased dramatically.

It has become a research hotspot to find an effective detection method to identify the lymph node metastasis of ESCC and avoid ineffective expanded lymphadenectomy .The molecular imaging technology has been developed for intra-operative visualization and precise resection of the tumors.

Indocyanine Green for Injection (ICG) has been used as a contrast agent in the near-infrared imaging system for the surgical navigation technology, which has a relatively positive effect in the clinical application of gastric cancer and liver cancer.There are few reports on the application of ICG near-infrared imaging tracer lymph nodes in the surgery of ESCC. This study intends to identify the detection rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) and determine the accuracy of regional lymph node metastasis in ESCC by ICG near-infrared imaging technique, which provides clinical evidence for subsequent precise resection of the lymph nodes.

This will be one-arm prospective trial. The ESCC patients will be recruited with strict criteria. 84 patients will be enrolled between18 and 75 years old, without gender limit. The submucosal injection of ICG will be performed preoperatively by gastroscopy on the superior and inferior edge of the esophageal tumor. NIR fluorescence imaging will be performed intraoperatively to observe the lymph nodes. The luminescent lymph node is defined as SLN. According to the standard procedure, 3 field lymphadenectomy will be performed, and all the resected lymph nodes will be subjected to pathological analysis including correlation study of fluorescence signal and tumor tissue in pathology slice.

This clinical trial is anticipated to evaluate the detection rate of SLN in ESCC with ICG near-infrared fluorescence imaging and determine the accuracy of regional lymph node metastasis.","Inclusion Criteria:

There are more than 25 proteins in the human body contain selenium, such as glutathione peroxidase and selenoprotein, which regulate the body's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Previous literatures had shown cancer patients have lower serum selenium concentrations than normal people, and lower serum selenium levels may be associated with increased cancer mortality. More than 50% of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer are malnourished before treatment, and these patients often have deficiency of trace elements, including selenium. In these malnourished patients, they may have to endure increased treatment toxicity and treatment interruption when receiving standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Interruption of treatment may lead to reduced therapeutic efficacy and compromised survival and recurrence rate. Several small studies have investigated whether oral administration of sodium selenite in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy can improve side effects and affect survival rates, but the results are inconsistent. Our study will use the intravenous form of sodium selenite (Zelnite®) to investigate the effect of selenium on the treatment outcomes of locally advanced head and neck cancer patients undergoing CCRT, such as therapy-related toxicities, quality of life, changes in selenium concentration in blood, nutritional, inflammation and immune markers, and tracking long-term survival and recurrence rates.","Inclusion Criteria:

This causes significant morbidity and has profound effects on the quality of life (QoL) of patients. While radiation-associated toxicities like xerostomia and dysphagia are part of large investigations, data on taste impairment is sparse.

The TASTE study sets out to further our understanding of this common side effect with the goal to prevent radiation-associated taste impairment in future patients.

In this prospective, observational multicenter study 150 head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy will be recruited. Participants will undergo repetitive (semi-) objective and subjective assessment of their taste, smell and salivary function at specific time points before, during and after radiotherapy. Primary endpoint will be patient-reported taste impairment 12 months post radiation therapy using a standardized quality of life questionnaire (MDASI-HN). Secondary endpoints will include taste impairment measured using taste strips at 12 months and 2 years post radiation therapy. Differences between subgroups (radiation side, chemotherapy, etc.) and changes over time will be assessed while adjusting for confounding factors (e.g. age, sex, smoking history). Based on the aquired data, a normal tissue complication probability model for late radiation-associated taste impairment will be develeoped.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT06423976,Microbiome Molecular Charaterisation,Prostate Cancer,Sequencing study,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Preclinical models of prostate cancer have proved to be poorly predictive of the behaviour of the disease in patients. This protocol describes the acquisition of prostate cancer tissue or cells from patients with treatment naïve/hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer or patients undergoing diagnostic or follow up investigations. The knowledge gained will improve the investigators' understanding of the steps leading to the development of castration resistance and identify new molecular targets for treatment.

The human microbiome has been under investigation in a range of human diseases (i.e. metabolic disease/obesity, neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease, mental disorders, autoimmune disease, asthma and allergies) and cancer. The human microbiota can have direct (e.g. via direct genotoxicity, induction of chronic inflammation, etc.) and/or indirect (e.g. effects on tumour effects on tumour development or progression exerted through microbial communities that exist at a site distant to the tumour) effects on the disease. Emerging data supports the influence of the gut microbiota on the efficacy of anti-cancer treatments, including immunotherapy. To date, the impact of the gut microbiome on prostate cancer therapies is virtually unexplored. Based on the evidence to date, the investigators hypothesize that the gut flora may be altered by certain treatments for advanced prostate cancer, and that the composition of the microbiome in the gastrointestinal tract may be used to predict therapeutic efficacy or therapy-related toxicities; as well as prevent treatment toxicity and/or enhance treatment response.

Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving cisplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride together with sorafenib tosylate may kill more tumor cells. Giving them before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

Much effort is currently focussed on exploring new molecular targeted agents that may improve upon survival. The addition of an agent that targets blood vessel formation in tumors, bevacizumab or Avastin, to conventional chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Data from animal studies have shown that bevacizumab and related agents also increase tumor cure rates when administered both during and after radiotherapy. This suggests that combined bevacizumab and chemo-radiation may improve survival in local-advanced disease as well. Before such clinical studies can commence, the safety and normal tissue toxicity profile of bevacizumab with thoracic radiotherapy must first be established.

Lenalidomide may help shrink or slow the growth of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as prednisone lower the body's immune response and are used with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer.

NCT00655876,"Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, and Radiation Therapy With or Without Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer",Esophageal Cancer,"cetuximab, cisplatin, paclitaxel, radiation therapy",INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may stop the growth of esophageal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving paclitaxel and cisplatin together with radiation therapy is more effective with or without cetuximab in treating esophageal cancer.

NCT00487760,African American Families and Lung Cancer Study,Lung Cancer,N/A,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"This study will learn more about the beliefs of family members of African American patients with lung cancer and whether these beliefs are associated with their interest in genetic testing for disease risk and willingness to participate in genetics research. Lung cancer is the second most common form of cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States. Like most cancers, there are racial and ethnic disparities (gaps) in lung cancer cases and deaths. The age-adjusted rates for blacks and whites (years 2000 to 2003) was 76.9 per 100,000 and 66.0 per 100,000, respectively. Mortality rates were 62.5 per 100,000 for blacks and 55.3 per 100,000 for whites. Cigarette smoking is the most preventable cause of lung cancer. Findings are that African Americans begin smoking at older ages and smoke fewer cigarettes per day than Caucasian Americans do. Yet the severity of lung cancer is greater for African Americans. Behavioral, social, environmental, and genetic factors may explain the differences.

Participants (subjects) ages 18 to 55 who are family of patients with lung cancer who self-identify as African Americans may be eligible for this study. Washington, D.C., researchers plan to recruit 115 lung cancer patients and 200 family members-100 current smokers and 100 who never smoked. Lung cancer patients, who must have been born in the United States, will be recruited from those who are receiving care at the Washington Cancer Institute at the Washington Hospital Center. They will be asked to list relatives and friends they consider to be as close as family. Patients will be asked permission for researchers to contact those people. Family members will receive a letter telling them that unless they decline to participate, they will be contacted by a telephone interviewer.

The survey will feature questions to evaluate family members' explanations for the causes of lung cancer, as well as their reactions to possible reasons for the disparity in lung cancer between African Americans and Caucasian Americans. Subjects will be asked about perceived personal risk, worry about developing lung cancer, smoking history, motivation to quit smoking, feelings about the lung cancer patient's diagnosis, racial identify, experience with racial discrimination, pros and cons of genetic testing, and interest in genetic testing. The survey will take up to 20 minutes to complete.

This study may or may not have a direct benefit for those who participate. However, lung cancer patients and their families will be offered a free self-help guide to stop smoking. They will be referred to local smoking cessation programs. Knowledge gained from the study may be used to design smoking cessation methods and research studies related to genetics for minority populations.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Patients:

In order to be included in this study, patients with lung cancer must meet inclusion criteria at 2 steps: (1) initial screening and written consent to be contacted by telephone, and (2) provision of verbal consent at the time of telephone contact to complete the survey.

Step 1a: In order to be approached about the study, patients must be (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) diagnosed with lung cancer at any stage (Stages Ia-IV), (3) approved for contact by their oncologist, and (4) identified by the recruiter or identified in medical records as Black.

Step 1b: In order to provide consent for contact for the telephone survey, patients must self-identify as AA/Black and must have been born in the U.S. Also, patients must be willing to give permission to contact at least one family member or friend considered as close as family who is a current cigarette smoker between the ages of 18 and 55 in order to provide consent.

Step 2: At the point of the patient survey, all patients will be asked their race/ethnicity. All patients who self-identify as AA/Black as defined by this research will be administered the patient survey.

Family:

Family members must self-identify as AA and be between the ages of 18 and 55 to be eligible for the study. Family also must meet the following inclusion criteria to be classified as either a current smoker (defined below) or a never smoker (defined below). These criteria for current smoker and never smoker are based on standard criteria used in smoking research.

Current Smoker: to be included as a smoker , the family member must report having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, and smoked 7 or more cigarettes in the past 7 days at the time of the family member survey.

Never Smokers: to be included as a never smoker , a family member must report no to having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

Former smokers (i.e., family who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime but smoked fewer than 7 cigarettes in the past 7 days) because previous research shows consistently that these individuals hold attitudes and beliefs more similar to those of current smokers than never smokers.

Patients who describe themselves as AA or Black but were not born in the U.S. will be excluded from participation.",400

NCT05512260,"Development, Implementation and Evaluation of an Individual Decision Aid in Swedish Cancer Screening Programs","Neoplasm, Colorectal, Neoplasm, Breast, Neoplasm, Ovarian",Individual decision aid (iDA),INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"Background: Sweden has a long tradition of organized national population-based screening programs. Participation rates differ between programs and regions, are relatively high in some groups, but lower in other. To apply an equity perspective on screening, it is desired that individuals make an informed decision on knowledge rather than ignorance, misconceptions, or fear. Decision Aids (DAs) are set to deliver information about different health care options and to help individuals make visible values connected to the options available. DAs are not meant to guide individuals to choose one option over the another. The advantage of an individual Decision Aid (iDA) is that individuals gain knowledge on cancer and screening entering one webpage with possibility to communicate with health professionals and thereafter make their decision regarding participate. The primary objective is therefore to develop and implement a web-based iDA for individuals invited to cancer screening in Sweden. The secondary objective is to evaluate the implemented web-based iDA.

Methods: This study has an evaluative approach with both a process-, an implementation and an outcome evaluation. Multiple methods will be used including patient reported data, focus group discussions and individual interviews using the think aloud technique. The project is based on the framework from The International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) and the proposed model development process for DAs as presented by Coulter et al. Individuals aged 23-74, including women aged (the cervical- and breast- and bowel cancer screening module) and men aged (the bowel cancer screening module), will be included in the developmental process. Efforts will be made to recruit participants with disabilities, who live outside society and who are foreign born.

Discussion: To the best of our knowledge the present study is the first aiming at developing an iDA for usage in Swedish context, The iDA is intended to contribute so that individuals invited to screening base their decision on knowledge and with a clear picture of their values and preferences, rather than ignorance, misconceptions, or fear. Furthermore, the iDA is expected to increase knowledge and raise awareness in general about cancer and cancer screening in society.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT04661176,"Evaluation of the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay for Diagnosis, Prognosis and Monitoring of Prostate Cancer in Puerto Rico",Prostate Cancer,miR Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"The miR Scientific Sentinel™ Prostate Cancer Classifier Platform (Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay) is a new molecular assay that interrogates 442 small non-coding RNAs extracted from urinary exosomes and provides urologists an early, very precise indication of disease status in men presenting with suspicion of prostate cancer. The assay classifies the disease status as having no molecular evidence of prostate cancer (NMEPC) or molecular evidence of low-, intermediate- or high-risk of aggressive, potentially lethal prostate cancer.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the clarity of explanation of the biological background and clinical impact of the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay, and the comfort level of urologists with the clinical data and report form, including the ease of understanding of results, and the potential use in clinical management of prostate cancer.

Men being seen by urologists in the course of their normal practice, presenting with suspicion of prostate cancer (based on DRE and/or elevated Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)) and scheduled for core-needle biopsy will be asked to consent to the clinical study and provide one or more 50 mL sample of non-DRE urine along with relevant anonymized clinical data with the study team. The urine samples will be shipped to miR Scientific laboratories in Rensselaer NY, for exosomal sncRNA extraction and interrogation. The molecular status of the participant will be reported as a Sentinel™ PCC4 Risk Level.

The second primary objective of this study is to establish the performance characteristics of the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay in the Puerto Rican population for identifying men with NMEPC, and men with evidence of high-risk prostate cancer.

Participants will receive the standard of care (SOC), including measurement of PSA, DRE and TRUS-guided systematic or MRI-guided targeted biopsy. Based on the histopathology report of the core-needle biopsy, read by pathologists associated with local institution, participants with no positive cores will be designated ""cancer-free""; otherwise patients with cancer in one or more cores will have the clinical data associated with the SOC collected (including the Gleason grade group, tumor staging, PSA, race and CAPRA risk assessment score). The CAPRA score will be compared to the molecular classification provided by the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay.","Inclusion Criteria:

1. Males with suspicion of prostate cancer including, but not limited to elevated PSA level, suspicious DRE, family history of prostate cancer, and/or germline mutation.
2. Signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-related procedures.
3. Minorities are included in this protocol.
4. The patient provided a urine sample within 30 days prior to biopsy being performed.
5. Patients who sign the consent form, but after shared decision making discussions with their urologist decide not to undergo a core needle biopsy. Since these may represent up to 5% of patients and represent the current SOC, these patients will be separately categorized as ""Prostate Biopsy Declined"" (PBD).

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Persons younger than 22 years of age. Since patients with germline mutations and/or family history may want to be screened before the age of 45 (as recommended by the NCCN) and some men over the age of 75 individuals may request a diagnostic core needle biopsy after shared decision making with their urologist, we have chosen not to include an age range that may exclude these individuals. The lower age limit is designed to exclude children from the study.
2. Persons incapable of providing informed consent.
3. Persons presenting with clinical symptoms of urinary tract infection, including prostatitis at the time of enrollment.

* Individuals may be prone to develop blood or lymph node cancers (leukemia or lymphoma) for a variety of reasons, including genetic predisposition to these cancers, environmental exposures or other medical conditions.
* Studies of people and families at high risk of cancer often lead to clues about their cause that may also be important regarding the sporadic occurrence of these cancers in the general population.
* Identifying genetic or environmental factors that play a role in the development of these diseases may be important in developing prevention trials, screening programs and treatments.

Objectives:

* Describe the cancers and other conditions in families with blood or lymph node cancer.
* Find and describe genes that may cause blood and lymph node cancer, and understand how they work in families.
* Use laboratory methods to try to determine if it is possible to identify who is at highest risk of blood or lymph node cancer.
* Test how genes act with other factors to alter the risk of disease, its severity or its manifestations in families.

Eligibility:

* Individuals of any age with a personal or family history of a blood or lymph node cancer.
* Individuals with a personal or family history of medical conditions or environmental exposures that may predispose to blood or lymph node cancer.

Design:

* Participants complete questionnaires about their personal and family medical history and provide consent for researchers to review their medical records and pathology materials related to their care and those of deceased relatives with blood or lymph node cancer, tumors, or other related illnesses for whom they are the legally authorized representative.
* Participants donate a sample of blood or cheek cells, or a lock of hair for genetic studies.
* Patients may also be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center by one or more of the following specialists: cancer doctor or blood specialist, medical geneticist, research nurses or clinical social worker. They may have blood and urine tests and a cheek swab or mouth wash to collect cheek cells. Some patients may also be asked to have x-rays and routine imaging, such as CT scans or ultrasound tests, cell surface markers, skin biopsy, and, with special consents, bone marrow biopsy, MRI or PET scans, apheresis or fluorescein angiography and photography.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

On referral, persons \>= 11 months will be included only because of personal history, and persons \>=18 years can also be included because of personal or family history of the parameters listed below:

* A medical history of hematologic/ lymphoproliferative malignancy of an unusual type, pattern, or number or

NCT03179176,Evaluation of the Interest of Ultra-high Frequency Doppler Ultrasound (UFDU) in the Surgical Management of Patients Operated in an Awake Condition for a Cerebral Tumor,Cerebral Tumor,High Frequence Ultrasound Doppler (HFUD) utilisation,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"In brain tumor surgery we are confronted mainly with two types of difficulties: (i) the identification of the tumor and its limitations in relation to the healthy brain; (ii) the identification of functional cerebral regions, ie implicated in neurological function (motor skills, sensitivity, language, vision, cognition, etc.). The reference method currently used to improve the quality of resection of brain tumors while minimizing neurological risk for patients is so called ""wakeful"" surgery with direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the brain. The investigators routinely use ultrasound to localize the tumor within the brain, but to date there is no pre- or intra-operative imaging tool to reliably identify tumors and functional brain regions. There is therefore a need for innovative imaging in this field.

For this reason, the investigators propose to evaluate the interest of a new High Frequence Ultrasound Doppler (HFUD) (VEVO ®, Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada) in the surgical management of patients operated in an awake condition for a brain tumor. The ultra high frequency allows to reach a spatial resolution of 30 μm, 5 to 10 times better than MRI and conventional ultrasound. The Doppler mode allows the detection of microvascular flows of speeds less than 1 mm / second. The safety of this device is demonstrated and validated by CE marking (December 2015).","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT03283527,Organoid Based Response Prediction in Esophageal Cancer,"Organoid, Esophageal Cancer, Chemoradiation",N/A,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,"Rationale: Current standard treatment of localized esophageal cancer (EC) with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by esophagectomy with curative intent results in 30% complete, 40-60% partial and 20% no-response at pathologic examination. Clinical response of nCRT is usually evaluated with PET-CT. However, response measurements are currently still insufficient in optimizing EC treatment. Proper pre-surgical response prediction may allow individualized treatment with esophagus-preservation in complete responders or switching to an alternative treatment in non-responders. Interestingly, in many tumors, a subset of cells has been found to possess cancer stem cell (CSC) properties with associated signaling as drivers of tumor (re-)growth and therapy resistance. Response of CSC-derived tissue resembling in vitro cultured tumor organoids may reflect patient's tumors sensitivity to therapy.

Objective: To create a patient derived organoid model for EC patients to predict the pathologic tumor response to nCRT in clinical practice. This will allow a more personalized approach in future treatment of locally advanced EC.

Study design: Fresh esophageal tumor material will be collected during diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in participating patients. These biopsies will be used to select cancer stem cells, which will be cultured to derive organoids (esophageal cancer patient derived organoids; EC-PDO). When the EC-PDO contain sufficient cells, these cells will be treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy in order to obtain dose-response curves. The response of these EC-PDOs will be compared to the actual tumor response to nCRT treatment in these EC patients, which will be assessed at the definitive pathologic examination of the resection specimen after esophagectomy with curative intent.

Study population: All patients with curatively treatable and resectable esophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) can be included in this trial.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint is response prediction to chemoradiotherapy by EC-PDO; the steepness of the dose response survival curve in the organoids in relation to the pathologic response after resection in the clinical situation.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The patients will be asked to undergo 3 to 6 additional biopsies during endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for the TNM staging of the tumor. The risk of these additional biopsies is not greater than the biopsies for the diagnosis of EC. The patient will not benefit from participation in this trial.

For the future approach we can get more insight into the mechanism of (chemo)radiation response or resistance to nCRT, which might lead to a better patient selection and more individualized esophageal cancer treatment in the future. This improvement in selection and treatment can result in less over or under-treatment of these EC patients.","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT01280227,Supporting Patient Provider Communication in Paediatric Care,"Cancer, Congenital Heart Disease",SiSom,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,"Children with Cancer or congenital heart disease (CHD) experience complex, physical, psychosocial and behavioural symptoms and problems due to the illness, treatment, and medical procedures. To help children cope with their problems and prevent psychological distress, the investigators developed SiSom, a support system to help children with cancer or CHD report their symptoms and problems in an age-adjusted manner on a touch-pad, portable computer.

This quasi-experimental study with 202 children age 7-12 with CHD or cancer will test the following hypotheses: When children use SiSom to report their symptoms and problems, and this information is provided to their clinicians in their outpatient consultations:

* Children and parents will experience less anxiety.
* Children and parents will be more satisfied with the outpatient visit.
* There will be greater congruence between children's reported symptoms and problems and those addressed by their clinicians as evidenced in documented patient care.

To better understand the mechanisms by which these effects may occur, the investigators will also explore:

* Differences between control and experimental groups in patient-provider communication in terms of instrumental and affective behaviour, participation, initiative and person addressed;
* The relationships among outcomes of patient-provider communication, congruence between patients' reported symptoms and those addressed by their clinicians and children's and parents' anxiety and satisfaction; and how these relationships differ between treatment and control conditions.

Finally, the investigators will investigate time requirements, ease of use and usefulness of SiSom by children and clinicians.

For analyses the investigators will use inferential statistics and qualitative analyses of the video-taped consultation sessions. This study will contribute to improving patient-centred care for a particularly vulnerable population, and to a better understanding of the triadic communication and interactions among child-parent and clinician.","Inclusion Criteria:

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision.
